!Series_summary = We obtained full transcriptome data from single cortical neurons after whole-cell patch-clamp recording (termed “Patch-seq”). By applying “Patch-seq” to cortical neurons, we reveal a close link between biophysical membrane properties and genes coding for neurotransmitter receptors and channels, including well-established and hitherto undescribed subtypes.

!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch1 = Coronal slices of primary somatosensory cortex were prepared in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Neurons were visualized by differential interference contrast microscopy and co-existence of DsRed and GFP in interneurons was confirmed by epifluorescence microsopy, and whole-cell patch clamp recordings were made.
!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = We used a dual reporter mouse line expressing discosoma red fluorescent protein (DsRed) under regulatory elements of the cholecystokinin promoter and green fluorescent protein (GFP) knocked into  the glutamate decarboxylase 67 gene .  Animals were group-housed under 12:12 h/h  light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to water and food. Animals of both sexes were used  for neurophysiology experiments during postnatal days 17-23.
!Sample_molecule_ch1 = polyA RNA
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = At the end of each patch-clamp protocol, the micropipette was clamped to a holding potential. The entire soma of each recorded neuron was aspirated into the micropipette slowly by applying negative pressure, and ejected into a drop of lysis buffer.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = 20 microL lysis buffer (0.15% Triton X-100, 1 U/microL TaKaRa RNase inhibitor, 4 microM reverse transcription primer C1-P1-T31, 5% C1 Loading Reagent and 1:50,000 Life Technologies ERCC  Spike-In Mix 1), reverse transcription mix (1x SuperScript II First-Strand Buffer supplemented with 3 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM dNTP, 4 mM DTT, 3.3% C1 Loading Reagent, 1.8 microM template-switching oligo C1-P1-RNA-TSO, 1.5 U/microL TaKaRa RNase inhibitor and 18 U/microL Life Technologies Superscript II reverse transcriptase) and PCR mix (1.1x Clontech Advantage2 PCR buffer, 440 microM dNTP, 530 nM PCR primer C1-P1-PCR-2, 5% C1 Loading Reagent and 2x Advantage2 Polymerase Mix) were added to the designated wells according to the manufacturer's instructions, but using the indicated mixes in place of the corresponding commmercial reagents. The plate was then returned to the Fluidigm C1 and the mRNA Seq: RT + Amp (1772x/1773x) script was executed, which took about 8.5 hours and included lysis, reverse transcription and 21 cycles of PCR. When the run finished, the amplified cDNA was harvested in a total of 13 microL C1 Harvesting Reagent and quantified on an Agilent BioAnalyzer. The typical yield was 1 ng/microL. Amplified cDNA was simultaneously fragmented and barcoded by tagmentation, i.e. using Tn5 DNA transposase to transfer adapters to the target DNA. 96 different 10x transposome stocks (6.25 microM barcoded adapter C1-TN5-x, 40% glycerol, 6.25 microM Tn5 transposase, where x denotes a well-specific barcode) were prepared, each with a different barcode sequence.  6 microL harvested cDNA was mixed with 5 microL tagmentation buffer (50 mM TAPS-NaOH pH 8.5, 25 mM MgCl2 and 50% DMF), 11.5 microL nuclease-free water and 2.5 microL 10x transposome stock. The mix was incubated for 5 minutes at 55 degeees C then cooled on ice. 100 microL Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 beads were washed in 2xBWT (10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 2 M NaCl, 0.02% Tween-20) then resuspended in 2 mL 2xBWT. 20 microL beads was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. All fractions were pooled, the beads were immobilized and the supernatant removed (thus removing all internal fragments, and retaining only the 5'- and 3'-most fragments). The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL TNT (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.02% Tween), washed in 100 microL Qiagen Qiaquick PB, then twice in 100 microL TNT. The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL restriction mix (1x NEB NEBuffer 4, 0.4 U/microL PvuI-HF enzyme), designed to cleave 3' fragments carrying the PvuI recognition site. The mix was incubated for one hour at 37 degrees C, then washed three times in TNT. Finally, the single-stranded library was eluted by resuspending the beads in 100 microL 100 mM NaOH, incubating for 5 minutes, removing the beads, then adding 100 microL 100 mM HCl and 50 microL Neutralization buffer (200 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween-20). At this point, the typical yield was 1-5 nM single-stranded library. Aliquots were rom these were run on  with 187ds_).
!Sample_data_processing = Read quality filtering and barcode extraction: Every read that was considered valid by the Illumina HiSeq control software was processed and filtered as follows: a) any 3' bases with a quality score of 'B' were removed; b) the well-identifying barcode was extracted from the 5' end of the read; c) if the read ended in a poly(A)-sequence leaving less than 25 transcript-derived bases, the read was discarded; d) the 8-base UMI was extracted from the 5' end and if any of the UMI bases had a Phred score less than 17 the read was discarded; e) a maximum of nine template-switching generated Gs were removed from the 5' end of the transcript-derived sequence; f) if the remaining sequence consisted of less than six non-A bases, or a dinucleotide repeat with less than six other bases at either end, the read was discarded.
!Sample_data_processing = Alignment:the reads were aligned to the genome using the Bowtie aligner, allowing for up to three mismatches and up to 24 alternative mappings for each read. The genome included an artifical chromosome, containing a concatamer of the ERCC control sequences. Any reads with no alignments were re-aligned against another artifical chromosome, containing all possible splice junctions arising from the exons defined by the known transcript variants. Reads mapping within these splice junctions were translated back to the corresponding actual genomic positions. The UCSC transcript models22 were used for the expression level calculation. If a locus had several transcript variants, the exons of these were merged to a combined model that represented all expression from the locus. To account for incompete cap site knowledge, the 5' ends of all models were extended by 100 bases, but not beyond the 3' end of any upstream nearby exon of another gene of the same orientation.
!Sample_data_processing = Annotation and quantitation: The annotation step was performed barcode-by-barcode. For every unique mapping (genomic position and strand) the number of reads in each UMI was counted. Any multiread that had one or more repeat mappings that was outside exons, was assigned randomly as one of these repeats and contributed to the summarized read count of that repeat class. Else, if it had one or more mappings to exons, it was assigned at the exon where it was closest to the transcript model 5' end, even if the sequence was repeat-like. If it had no exon mapping, it was assigned randomly at one of the mappings. After assigning reads, the number of molecules at each mapping position was determined by the number of distinct UMIs observed. To account for UMIs that stem from PCR-induced mutations or sequencing errors, any UMI that had fewer reads than 1/100 of the average of the non-zero UMIs was excluded. The raw UMI count was corrected for the UMI collision probability (important only at high UMI counts) as described10. The expression level of each transcript model was taken as the total number of molecules at all its possible mapping positions.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = 20 microL lysis buffer (0.15% Triton X-100, 1 U/microL TaKaRa RNase inhibitor, 4 microM reverse transcription primer C1-P1-T31, 5% C1 Loading Reagent and 1:50,000 Life Technologies ERCC  Spike-In Mix 1), reverse transcription mix (1x SuperScript II First-Strand Buffer supplemented with 3 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM dNTP, 4 mM DTT, 3.3% C1 Loading Reagent, 1.8 microM template-switching oligo C1-P1-RNA-TSO, 1.5 U/microL TaKaRa RNase inhibitor and 18 U/microL Life Technologies Superscript II reverse transcriptase) and PCR mix (1.1x Clontech Advantage2 PCR buffer, 440 microM dNTP, 530 nM PCR primer C1-P1-PCR-2, 5% C1 Loading Reagent and 2x Advantage2 Polymerase Mix) were added to the designated wells according to the manufacturer's instructions, but using the indicated mixes in place of the corresponding commmercial reagents. The plate was then returned to the Fluidigm C1 and the mRNA Seq: RT + Amp (1772x/1773x) script was executed, which took about 8.5 hours and included lysis, reverse transcription and 21 cycles of PCR. When the run finished, the amplified cDNA was harvested in a total of 13 microL C1 Harvesting Reagent and quantified on an Agilent BioAnalyzer. The typical yield was 1 ng/microL. Amplified cDNA was simultaneously fragmented and barcoded by tagmentation, i.e. using Tn5 DNA transposase to transfer adapters to the target DNA. 96 different 10x transposome stocks (6.25 microM barcoded adapter C1-TN5-x, 40% glycerol, 6.25 microM Tn5 transposase, where x denotes a well-specific barcode) were prepared, each with a different barcode sequence.  6 microL harvested cDNA was mixed with 5 microL tagmentation buffer (50 mM TAPS-NaOH pH 8.5, 25 mM MgCl2 and 50% DMF), 11.5 microL nuclease-free water and 2.5 microL 10x transposome stock. The mix was incubated for 5 minutes at 55 degeees C then cooled on ice. 100 microL Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 beads were washed in 2xBWT (10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 2 M NaCl, 0.02% Tween-20) then resuspended in 2 mL 2xBWT. 20 microL beads was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. All fractions were pooled, the beads were immobilized and the supernatant removed (thus removing all internal fragments, and retaining only the 5'- and 3'-most fragments). The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL TNT (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.02% Tween), washed in 100 microL Qiagen Qiaquick PB, then twice in 100 microL TNT. The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL restriction mix (1x NEB NEBuffer 4, 0.4 U/microL PvuI-HF enzyme), designed to cleave 3' fragments carrying the PvuI recognition site. The mix was incubated for one hour at 37 degrees C, then washed three times in TNT. Finally, the single-stranded library was eluted by resuspending the beads in 100 microL 100 mM NaOH, incubating for 5 minutes, removing the beads, then adding 100 microL 100 mM HCl and 50 microL Neutralization buffer (200 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween-20). At this point, the typical yield was 1-5 nM single-stranded library. Aliquots were rom these were run on  with 187ds_).
!Sample_data_processing = Read quality filtering and barcode extraction: Every read that was considered valid by the Illumina HiSeq control software was processed and filtered as follows: a) any 3' bases with a quality score of 'B' were removed; b) the well-identifying barcode was extracted from the 5' end of the read; c) if the read ended in a poly(A)-sequence leaving less than 25 transcript-derived bases, the read was discarded; d) the 8-base UMI was extracted from the 5' end and if any of the UMI bases had a Phred score less than 17 the read was discarded; e) a maximum of nine template-switching generated Gs were removed from the 5' end of the transcript-derived sequence; f) if the remaining sequence consisted of less than six non-A bases, or a dinucleotide repeat with less than six other bases at either end, the read was discarded.
!Sample_data_processing = Alignment:the reads were aligned to the genome using the Bowtie aligner, allowing for up to three mismatches and up to 24 alternative mappings for each read. The genome included an artifical chromosome, containing a concatamer of the ERCC control sequences. Any reads with no alignments were re-aligned against another artifical chromosome, containing all possible splice junctions arising from the exons defined by the known transcript variants. Reads mapping within these splice junctions were translated back to the corresponding actual genomic positions. The UCSC transcript models22 were used for the expression level calculation. If a locus had several transcript variants, the exons of these were merged to a combined model that represented all expression from the locus. To account for incompete cap site knowledge, the 5' ends of all models were extended by 100 bases, but not beyond the 3' end of any upstream nearby exon of another gene of the same orientation.
!Sample_data_processing = Annotation and quantitation: The annotation step was performed barcode-by-barcode. For every unique mapping (genomic position and strand) the number of reads in each UMI was counted. Any multiread that had one or more repeat mappings that was outside exons, was assigned randomly as one of these repeats and contributed to the summarized read count of that repeat class. Else, if it had one or more mappings to exons, it was assigned at the exon where it was closest to the transcript model 5' end, even if the sequence was repeat-like. If it had no exon mapping, it was assigned randomly at one of the mappings. After assigning reads, the number of molecules at each mapping position was determined by the number of distinct UMIs observed. To account for UMIs that stem from PCR-induced mutations or sequencing errors, any UMI that had fewer reads than 1/100 of the average of the non-zero UMIs was excluded. The raw UMI count was corrected for the UMI collision probability (important only at high UMI counts) as described10. The expression level of each transcript model was taken as the total number of molecules at all its possible mapping positions.

When the run finished, the amplified cDNA was harvested in a total of 13 microL C1 Harvesting Reagent and quantified on an Agilent BioAnalyzer. The typical yield was 1 ng/microL. Amplified cDNA was simultaneously fragmented and barcoded by tagmentation, i.e. using Tn5 DNA transposase to transfer adapters to the target DNA. 96 different 10x transposome stocks (6.25 microM barcoded adapter C1-TN5-x, 40% glycerol, 6.25 microM Tn5 transposase, where x denotes a well-specific barcode) were prepared, each with a different barcode sequence.  6 microL harvested cDNA was mixed with 5 microL tagmentation buffer (50 mM TAPS-NaOH pH 8.5, 25 mM MgCl2 and 50% DMF), 11.5 microL nuclease-free water and 2.5 microL 10x transposome stock. The mix was incubated for 5 minutes at 55 degeees C then cooled on ice. 100 microL Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 beads were washed in 2xBWT (10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 2 M NaCl, 0.02% Tween-20) then resuspended in 2 mL 2xBWT. 20 microL beads was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. All fractions were pooled, the beads were immobilized and the supernatant removed (thus removing all internal fragments, and retaining only the 5'- and 3'-most fragments). The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL TNT (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.02% Tween), washed in 100 microL Qiagen Qiaquick PB, then twice in 100 microL TNT. The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL restriction mix (1x NEB NEBuffer 4, 0.4 U/microL PvuI-HF enzyme), designed to cleave 3' fragments carrying the PvuI recognition site. The mix was incubated for one hour at 37 degrees C, then washed three times in TNT. Finally, the single-stranded library was eluted by resuspending the beads in 100 microL 100 mM NaOH, incubating for 5 minutes, removing the beads, then adding 100 microL 100 mM HCl and 50 microL Neutralization buffer (200 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween-20). At this point, the typical yield was 1-5 nM single-stranded library. Aliquots were rom these were run on  with 187ds_).
!Sample_data_processing = Read quality filtering and barcode extraction: Every read that was considered valid by the Illumina HiSeq control software was processed and filtered as follows: a) any 3' bases with a quality score of 'B' were removed; b) the well-identifying barcode was extracted from the 5' end of the read; c) if the read ended in a poly(A)-sequence leaving less than 25 transcript-derived bases, the read was discarded; d) the 8-base UMI was extracted from the 5' end and if any of the UMI bases had a Phred score less than 17 the read was discarded; e) a maximum of nine template-switching generated Gs were removed from the 5' end of the transcript-derived sequence; f) if the remaining sequence consisted of less than six non-A bases, or a dinucleotide repeat with less than six other bases at either end, the read was discarded.
!Sample_data_processing = Alignment:the reads were aligned to the genome using the Bowtie aligner, allowing for up to three mismatches and up to 24 alternative mappings for each read. The genome included an artifical chromosome, containing a concatamer of the ERCC control sequences. Any reads with no alignments were re-aligned against another artifical chromosome, containing all possible splice junctions arising from the exons defined by the known transcript variants. Reads mapping within these splice junctions were translated back to the corresponding actual genomic positions. The UCSC transcript models22 were used for the expression level calculation. If a locus had several transcript variants, the exons of these were merged to a combined model that represented all expression from the locus. To account for incompete cap site knowledge, the 5' ends of all models were extended by 100 bases, but not beyond the 3' end of any upstream nearby exon of another gene of the same orientation.
!Sample_data_processing = Annotation and quantitation: The annotation step was performed barcode-by-barcode. For every unique mapping (genomic position and strand) the number of reads in each UMI was counted. Any multiread that had one or more repeat mappings that was outside exons, was assigned randomly as one of these repeats and contributed to the summarized read count of that repeat class. Else, if it had one or more mappings to exons, it was assigned at the exon where it was closest to the transcript model 5' end, even if the sequence was repeat-like. If it had no exon mapping, it was assigned randomly at one of the mappings. After assigning reads, the number of molecules at each mapping position was determined by the number of distinct UMIs observed. To account for UMIs that stem from PCR-induced mutations or sequencing errors, any UMI that had fewer reads than 1/100 of the average of the non-zero UMIs was excluded. The raw UMI count was corrected for the UMI collision probability (important only at high UMI counts) as described10. The expression level of each transcript model was taken as the total number of molecules at all its possible mapping positions.

Amplified cDNA was simultaneously fragmented and barcoded by tagmentation, i.e. using Tn5 DNA transposase to transfer adapters to the target DNA. 96 different 10x transposome stocks (6.25 microM barcoded adapter C1-TN5-x, 40% glycerol, 6.25 microM Tn5 transposase, where x denotes a well-specific barcode) were prepared, each with a different barcode sequence.  6 microL harvested cDNA was mixed with 5 microL tagmentation buffer (50 mM TAPS-NaOH pH 8.5, 25 mM MgCl2 and 50% DMF), 11.5 microL nuclease-free water and 2.5 microL 10x transposome stock. The mix was incubated for 5 minutes at 55 degeees C then cooled on ice. 100 microL Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 beads were washed in 2xBWT (10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 2 M NaCl, 0.02% Tween-20) then resuspended in 2 mL 2xBWT. 20 microL beads was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. All fractions were pooled, the beads were immobilized and the supernatant removed (thus removing all internal fragments, and retaining only the 5'- and 3'-most fragments). The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL TNT (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.02% Tween), washed in 100 microL Qiagen Qiaquick PB, then twice in 100 microL TNT. The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL restriction mix (1x NEB NEBuffer 4, 0.4 U/microL PvuI-HF enzyme), designed to cleave 3' fragments carrying the PvuI recognition site. The mix was incubated for one hour at 37 degrees C, then washed three times in TNT. Finally, the single-stranded library was eluted by resuspending the beads in 100 microL 100 mM NaOH, incubating for 5 minutes, removing the beads, then adding 100 microL 100 mM HCl and 50 microL Neutralization buffer (200 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween-20). At this point, the typical yield was 1-5 nM single-stranded library. Aliquots were rom these were run on  with 187ds_).
!Sample_data_processing = Read quality filtering and barcode extraction: Every read that was considered valid by the Illumina HiSeq control software was processed and filtered as follows: a) any 3' bases with a quality score of 'B' were removed; b) the well-identifying barcode was extracted from the 5' end of the read; c) if the read ended in a poly(A)-sequence leaving less than 25 transcript-derived bases, the read was discarded; d) the 8-base UMI was extracted from the 5' end and if any of the UMI bases had a Phred score less than 17 the read was discarded; e) a maximum of nine template-switching generated Gs were removed from the 5' end of the transcript-derived sequence; f) if the remaining sequence consisted of less than six non-A bases, or a dinucleotide repeat with less than six other bases at either end, the read was discarded.
!Sample_data_processing = Alignment:the reads were aligned to the genome using the Bowtie aligner, allowing for up to three mismatches and up to 24 alternative mappings for each read. The genome included an artifical chromosome, containing a concatamer of the ERCC control sequences. Any reads with no alignments were re-aligned against another artifical chromosome, containing all possible splice junctions arising from the exons defined by the known transcript variants. Reads mapping within these splice junctions were translated back to the corresponding actual genomic positions. The UCSC transcript models22 were used for the expression level calculation. If a locus had several transcript variants, the exons of these were merged to a combined model that represented all expression from the locus. To account for incompete cap site knowledge, the 5' ends of all models were extended by 100 bases, but not beyond the 3' end of any upstream nearby exon of another gene of the same orientation.
!Sample_data_processing = Annotation and quantitation: The annotation step was performed barcode-by-barcode. For every unique mapping (genomic position and strand) the number of reads in each UMI was counted. Any multiread that had one or more repeat mappings that was outside exons, was assigned randomly as one of these repeats and contributed to the summarized read count of that repeat class. Else, if it had one or more mappings to exons, it was assigned at the exon where it was closest to the transcript model 5' end, even if the sequence was repeat-like. If it had no exon mapping, it was assigned randomly at one of the mappings. After assigning reads, the number of molecules at each mapping position was determined by the number of distinct UMIs observed. To account for UMIs that stem from PCR-induced mutations or sequencing errors, any UMI that had fewer reads than 1/100 of the average of the non-zero UMIs was excluded. The raw UMI count was corrected for the UMI collision probability (important only at high UMI counts) as described10. The expression level of each transcript model was taken as the total number of molecules at all its possible mapping positions.

All fractions were pooled, the beads were immobilized and the supernatant removed (thus removing all internal fragments, and retaining only the 5'- and 3'-most fragments). The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL TNT (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.02% Tween), washed in 100 microL Qiagen Qiaquick PB, then twice in 100 microL TNT. The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL restriction mix (1x NEB NEBuffer 4, 0.4 U/microL PvuI-HF enzyme), designed to cleave 3' fragments carrying the PvuI recognition site. The mix was incubated for one hour at 37 degrees C, then washed three times in TNT. Finally, the single-stranded library was eluted by resuspending the beads in 100 microL 100 mM NaOH, incubating for 5 minutes, removing the beads, then adding 100 microL 100 mM HCl and 50 microL Neutralization buffer (200 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween-20). At this point, the typical yield was 1-5 nM single-stranded library. Aliquots were rom these were run on  with 187ds_).
!Sample_data_processing = Read quality filtering and barcode extraction: Every read that was considered valid by the Illumina HiSeq control software was processed and filtered as follows: a) any 3' bases with a quality score of 'B' were removed; b) the well-identifying barcode was extracted from the 5' end of the read; c) if the read ended in a poly(A)-sequence leaving less than 25 transcript-derived bases, the read was discarded; d) the 8-base UMI was extracted from the 5' end and if any of the UMI bases had a Phred score less than 17 the read was discarded; e) a maximum of nine template-switching generated Gs were removed from the 5' end of the transcript-derived sequence; f) if the remaining sequence consisted of less than six non-A bases, or a dinucleotide repeat with less than six other bases at either end, the read was discarded.
!Sample_data_processing = Alignment:the reads were aligned to the genome using the Bowtie aligner, allowing for up to three mismatches and up to 24 alternative mappings for each read. The genome included an artifical chromosome, containing a concatamer of the ERCC control sequences. Any reads with no alignments were re-aligned against another artifical chromosome, containing all possible splice junctions arising from the exons defined by the known transcript variants. Reads mapping within these splice junctions were translated back to the corresponding actual genomic positions. The UCSC transcript models22 were used for the expression level calculation. If a locus had several transcript variants, the exons of these were merged to a combined model that represented all expression from the locus. To account for incompete cap site knowledge, the 5' ends of all models were extended by 100 bases, but not beyond the 3' end of any upstream nearby exon of another gene of the same orientation.
!Sample_data_processing = Annotation and quantitation: The annotation step was performed barcode-by-barcode. For every unique mapping (genomic position and strand) the number of reads in each UMI was counted. Any multiread that had one or more repeat mappings that was outside exons, was assigned randomly as one of these repeats and contributed to the summarized read count of that repeat class. Else, if it had one or more mappings to exons, it was assigned at the exon where it was closest to the transcript model 5' end, even if the sequence was repeat-like. If it had no exon mapping, it was assigned randomly at one of the mappings. After assigning reads, the number of molecules at each mapping position was determined by the number of distinct UMIs observed. To account for UMIs that stem from PCR-induced mutations or sequencing errors, any UMI that had fewer reads than 1/100 of the average of the non-zero UMIs was excluded. The raw UMI count was corrected for the UMI collision probability (important only at high UMI counts) as described10. The expression level of each transcript model was taken as the total number of molecules at all its possible mapping positions.

The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL restriction mix (1x NEB NEBuffer 4, 0.4 U/microL PvuI-HF enzyme), designed to cleave 3' fragments carrying the PvuI recognition site. The mix was incubated for one hour at 37 degrees C, then washed three times in TNT. Finally, the single-stranded library was eluted by resuspending the beads in 100 microL 100 mM NaOH, incubating for 5 minutes, removing the beads, then adding 100 microL 100 mM HCl and 50 microL Neutralization buffer (200 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween-20). At this point, the typical yield was 1-5 nM single-stranded library. Aliquots were rom these were run on  with 187ds_).
!Sample_data_processing = Read quality filtering and barcode extraction: Every read that was considered valid by the Illumina HiSeq control software was processed and filtered as follows: a) any 3' bases with a quality score of 'B' were removed; b) the well-identifying barcode was extracted from the 5' end of the read; c) if the read ended in a poly(A)-sequence leaving less than 25 transcript-derived bases, the read was discarded; d) the 8-base UMI was extracted from the 5' end and if any of the UMI bases had a Phred score less than 17 the read was discarded; e) a maximum of nine template-switching generated Gs were removed from the 5' end of the transcript-derived sequence; f) if the remaining sequence consisted of less than six non-A bases, or a dinucleotide repeat with less than six other bases at either end, the read was discarded.
!Sample_data_processing = Alignment:the reads were aligned to the genome using the Bowtie aligner, allowing for up to three mismatches and up to 24 alternative mappings for each read. The genome included an artifical chromosome, containing a concatamer of the ERCC control sequences. Any reads with no alignments were re-aligned against another artifical chromosome, containing all possible splice junctions arising from the exons defined by the known transcript variants. Reads mapping within these splice junctions were translated back to the corresponding actual genomic positions. The UCSC transcript models22 were used for the expression level calculation. If a locus had several transcript variants, the exons of these were merged to a combined model that represented all expression from the locus. To account for incompete cap site knowledge, the 5' ends of all models were extended by 100 bases, but not beyond the 3' end of any upstream nearby exon of another gene of the same orientation.
!Sample_data_processing = Annotation and quantitation: The annotation step was performed barcode-by-barcode. For every unique mapping (genomic position and strand) the number of reads in each UMI was counted. Any multiread that had one or more repeat mappings that was outside exons, was assigned randomly as one of these repeats and contributed to the summarized read count of that repeat class. Else, if it had one or more mappings to exons, it was assigned at the exon where it was closest to the transcript model 5' end, even if the sequence was repeat-like. If it had no exon mapping, it was assigned randomly at one of the mappings. After assigning reads, the number of molecules at each mapping position was determined by the number of distinct UMIs observed. To account for UMIs that stem from PCR-induced mutations or sequencing errors, any UMI that had fewer reads than 1/100 of the average of the non-zero UMIs was excluded. The raw UMI count was corrected for the UMI collision probability (important only at high UMI counts) as described10. The expression level of each transcript model was taken as the total number of molecules at all its possible mapping positions.

!Sample_data_processing = Read quality filtering and barcode extraction: Every read that was considered valid by the Illumina HiSeq control software was processed and filtered as follows: a) any 3' bases with a quality score of 'B' were removed; b) the well-identifying barcode was extracted from the 5' end of the read; c) if the read ended in a poly(A)-sequence leaving less than 25 transcript-derived bases, the read was discarded; d) the 8-base UMI was extracted from the 5' end and if any of the UMI bases had a Phred score less than 17 the read was discarded; e) a maximum of nine template-switching generated Gs were removed from the 5' end of the transcript-derived sequence; f) if the remaining sequence consisted of less than six non-A bases, or a dinucleotide repeat with less than six other bases at either end, the read was discarded.
!Sample_data_processing = Alignment:the reads were aligned to the genome using the Bowtie aligner, allowing for up to three mismatches and up to 24 alternative mappings for each read. The genome included an artifical chromosome, containing a concatamer of the ERCC control sequences. Any reads with no alignments were re-aligned against another artifical chromosome, containing all possible splice junctions arising from the exons defined by the known transcript variants. Reads mapping within these splice junctions were translated back to the corresponding actual genomic positions. The UCSC transcript models22 were used for the expression level calculation. If a locus had several transcript variants, the exons of these were merged to a combined model that represented all expression from the locus. To account for incompete cap site knowledge, the 5' ends of all models were extended by 100 bases, but not beyond the 3' end of any upstream nearby exon of another gene of the same orientation.
!Sample_data_processing = Annotation and quantitation: The annotation step was performed barcode-by-barcode. For every unique mapping (genomic position and strand) the number of reads in each UMI was counted. Any multiread that had one or more repeat mappings that was outside exons, was assigned randomly as one of these repeats and contributed to the summarized read count of that repeat class. Else, if it had one or more mappings to exons, it was assigned at the exon where it was closest to the transcript model 5' end, even if the sequence was repeat-like. If it had no exon mapping, it was assigned randomly at one of the mappings. After assigning reads, the number of molecules at each mapping position was determined by the number of distinct UMIs observed. To account for UMIs that stem from PCR-induced mutations or sequencing errors, any UMI that had fewer reads than 1/100 of the average of the non-zero UMIs was excluded. The raw UMI count was corrected for the UMI collision probability (important only at high UMI counts) as described10. The expression level of each transcript model was taken as the total number of molecules at all its possible mapping positions.

The plate was then returned to the Fluidigm C1 and the mRNA Seq: RT + Amp (1772x/1773x) script was executed, which took about 8.5 hours and included lysis, reverse transcription and 21 cycles of PCR. When the run finished, the amplified cDNA was harvested in a total of 13 microL C1 Harvesting Reagent and quantified on an Agilent BioAnalyzer. The typical yield was 1 ng/microL.

Any reads with no alignments were re-aligned against another artifical chromosome, containing all possible splice junctions arising from the exons defined by the known transcript variants. Reads mapping within these splice junctions were translated back to the corresponding actual genomic positions. The UCSC transcript models22 were used for the expression level calculation. If a locus had several transcript variants, the exons of these were merged to a combined model that represented all expression from the locus. To account for incompete cap site knowledge, the 5' ends of all models were extended by 100 bases, but not beyond the 3' end of any upstream nearby exon of another gene of the same orientation.
!Sample_data_processing = Annotation and quantitation: The annotation step was performed barcode-by-barcode. For every unique mapping (genomic position and strand) the number of reads in each UMI was counted. Any multiread that had one or more repeat mappings that was outside exons, was assigned randomly as one of these repeats and contributed to the summarized read count of that repeat class. Else, if it had one or more mappings to exons, it was assigned at the exon where it was closest to the transcript model 5' end, even if the sequence was repeat-like. If it had no exon mapping, it was assigned randomly at one of the mappings. After assigning reads, the number of molecules at each mapping position was determined by the number of distinct UMIs observed. To account for UMIs that stem from PCR-induced mutations or sequencing errors, any UMI that had fewer reads than 1/100 of the average of the non-zero UMIs was excluded. The raw UMI count was corrected for the UMI collision probability (important only at high UMI counts) as described10. The expression level of each transcript model was taken as the total number of molecules at all its possible mapping positions.

!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = We used a dual reporter mouse line expressing discosoma red fluorescent protein (DsRed) under regulatory elements of the cholecystokinin promoter and green fluorescent protein (GFP) knocked into  the glutamate decarboxylase 67 gene .  Animals were group-housed under 12:12 h/h  light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to water and food. Animals of both sexes were used  for neurophysiology experiments during postnatal days 17-23.

The plate was then returned to the Fluidigm C1 and the mRNA Seq: RT + Amp (1772x/1773x) script was executed, which took about 8.5 hours and included lysis, reverse transcription and 21 cycles of PCR. When the run finished, the amplified cDNA was harvested in a total of 13 microL C1 Harvesting Reagent and quantified on an Agilent BioAnalyzer. The typical yield was 1 ng/microL. Amplified cDNA was simultaneously fragmented and barcoded by tagmentation, i.e. using Tn5 DNA transposase to transfer adapters to the target DNA. 96 different 10x transposome stocks (6.25 microM barcoded adapter C1-TN5-x, 40% glycerol, 6.25 microM Tn5 transposase, where x denotes a well-specific barcode) were prepared, each with a different barcode sequence.  6 microL harvested cDNA was mixed with 5 microL tagmentation buffer (50 mM TAPS-NaOH pH 8.5, 25 mM MgCl2 and 50% DMF), 11.5 microL nuclease-free water and 2.5 microL 10x transposome stock. The mix was incubated for 5 minutes at 55 degeees C then cooled on ice. 100 microL Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 beads were washed in 2xBWT (10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 2 M NaCl, 0.02% Tween-20) then resuspended in 2 mL 2xBWT. 20 microL beads was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. All fractions were pooled, the beads were immobilized and the supernatant removed (thus removing all internal fragments, and retaining only the 5'- and 3'-most fragments). The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL TNT (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.02% Tween), washed in 100 microL Qiagen Qiaquick PB, then twice in 100 microL TNT. The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL restriction mix (1x NEB NEBuffer 4, 0.4 U/microL PvuI-HF enzyme), designed to cleave 3' fragments carrying the PvuI recognition site. The mix was incubated for one hour at 37 degrees C, then washed three times in TNT. Finally, the single-stranded library was eluted by resuspending the beads in 100 microL 100 mM NaOH, incubating for 5 minutes, removing the beads, then adding 100 microL 100 mM HCl and 50 microL Neutralization buffer (200 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween-20). At this point, the typical yield was 1-5 nM single-stranded library. Aliquots were rom these were run on  with 187ds_).

To account for UMIs that stem from PCR-induced mutations or sequencing errors, any UMI that had fewer reads than 1/100 of the average of the non-zero UMIs was excluded. The raw UMI count was corrected for the UMI collision probability (important only at high UMI counts) as described10. The expression level of each transcript model was taken as the total number of molecules at all its possible mapping positions.

Neurons were visualized by differential interference contrast microscopy and co-existence of DsRed and GFP in interneurons was confirmed by epifluorescence microsopy, and whole-cell patch clamp recordings were made.
!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = We used a dual reporter mouse line expressing discosoma red fluorescent protein (DsRed) under regulatory elements of the cholecystokinin promoter and green fluorescent protein (GFP) knocked into  the glutamate decarboxylase 67 gene .  Animals were group-housed under 12:12 h/h  light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to water and food. Animals of both sexes were used  for neurophysiology experiments during postnatal days 17-23.
!Sample_molecule_ch1 = polyA RNA
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = At the end of each patch-clamp protocol, the micropipette was clamped to a holding potential. The entire soma of each recorded neuron was aspirated into the micropipette slowly by applying negative pressure, and ejected into a drop of lysis buffer.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = 20 microL lysis buffer (0.15% Triton X-100, 1 U/microL TaKaRa RNase inhibitor, 4 microM reverse transcription primer C1-P1-T31, 5% C1 Loading Reagent and 1:50,000 Life Technologies ERCC  Spike-In Mix 1), reverse transcription mix (1x SuperScript II First-Strand Buffer supplemented with 3 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM dNTP, 4 mM DTT, 3.3% C1 Loading Reagent, 1.8 microM template-switching oligo C1-P1-RNA-TSO, 1.5 U/microL TaKaRa RNase inhibitor and 18 U/microL Life Technologies Superscript II reverse transcriptase) and PCR mix (1.1x Clontech Advantage2 PCR buffer, 440 microM dNTP, 530 nM PCR primer C1-P1-PCR-2, 5% C1 Loading Reagent and 2x Advantage2 Polymerase Mix) were added to the designated wells according to the manufacturer's instructions, but using the indicated mixes in place of the corresponding commmercial reagents. The plate was then returned to the Fluidigm C1 and the mRNA Seq: RT + Amp (1772x/1773x) script was executed, which took about 8.5 hours and included lysis, reverse transcription and 21 cycles of PCR. When the run finished, the amplified cDNA was harvested in a total of 13 microL C1 Harvesting Reagent and quantified on an Agilent BioAnalyzer. The typical yield was 1 ng/microL. Amplified cDNA was simultaneously fragmented and barcoded by tagmentation, i.e. using Tn5 DNA transposase to transfer adapters to the target DNA. 96 different 10x transposome stocks (6.25 microM barcoded adapter C1-TN5-x, 40% glycerol, 6.25 microM Tn5 transposase, where x denotes a well-specific barcode) were prepared, each with a different barcode sequence.  6 microL harvested cDNA was mixed with 5 microL tagmentation buffer (50 mM TAPS-NaOH pH 8.5, 25 mM MgCl2 and 50% DMF), 11.5 microL nuclease-free water and 2.5 microL 10x transposome stock. The mix was incubated for 5 minutes at 55 degeees C then cooled on ice. 100 microL Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 beads were washed in 2xBWT (10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 2 M NaCl, 0.02% Tween-20) then resuspended in 2 mL 2xBWT. 20 microL beads was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. All fractions were pooled, the beads were immobilized and the supernatant removed (thus removing all internal fragments, and retaining only the 5'- and 3'-most fragments). The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL TNT (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.02% Tween), washed in 100 microL Qiagen Qiaquick PB, then twice in 100 microL TNT. The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL restriction mix (1x NEB NEBuffer 4, 0.4 U/microL PvuI-HF enzyme), designed to cleave 3' fragments carrying the PvuI recognition site. The mix was incubated for one hour at 37 degrees C, then washed three times in TNT. Finally, the single-stranded library was eluted by resuspending the beads in 100 microL 100 mM NaOH, incubating for 5 minutes, removing the beads, then adding 100 microL 100 mM HCl and 50 microL Neutralization buffer (200 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween-20). At this point, the typical yield was 1-5 nM single-stranded library. Aliquots were rom these were run on  with 187ds_).
!Sample_data_processing = Read quality filtering and barcode extraction: Every read that was considered valid by the Illumina HiSeq control software was processed and filtered as follows: a) any 3' bases with a quality score of 'B' were removed; b) the well-identifying barcode was extracted from the 5' end of the read; c) if the read ended in a poly(A)-sequence leaving less than 25 transcript-derived bases, the read was discarded; d) the 8-base UMI was extracted from the 5' end and if any of the UMI bases had a Phred score less than 17 the read was discarded; e) a maximum of nine template-switching generated Gs were removed from the 5' end of the transcript-derived sequence; f) if the remaining sequence consisted of less than six non-A bases, or a dinucleotide repeat with less than six other bases at either end, the read was discarded.
!Sample_data_processing = Alignment:the reads were aligned to the genome using the Bowtie aligner, allowing for up to three mismatches and up to 24 alternative mappings for each read. The genome included an artifical chromosome, containing a concatamer of the ERCC control sequences. Any reads with no alignments were re-aligned against another artifical chromosome, containing all possible splice junctions arising from the exons defined by the known transcript variants. Reads mapping within these splice junctions were translated back to the corresponding actual genomic positions. The UCSC transcript models22 were used for the expression level calculation. If a locus had several transcript variants, the exons of these were merged to a combined model that represented all expression from the locus. To account for incompete cap site knowledge, the 5' ends of all models were extended by 100 bases, but not beyond the 3' end of any upstream nearby exon of another gene of the same orientation.
!Sample_data_processing = Annotation and quantitation: The annotation step was performed barcode-by-barcode. For every unique mapping (genomic position and strand) the number of reads in each UMI was counted. Any multiread that had one or more repeat mappings that was outside exons, was assigned randomly as one of these repeats and contributed to the summarized read count of that repeat class. Else, if it had one or more mappings to exons, it was assigned at the exon where it was closest to the transcript model 5' end, even if the sequence was repeat-like. If it had no exon mapping, it was assigned randomly at one of the mappings. After assigning reads, the number of molecules at each mapping position was determined by the number of distinct UMIs observed.

Neurons were visualized by differential interference contrast microscopy and co-existence of DsRed and GFP in interneurons was confirmed by epifluorescence microsopy, and whole-cell patch clamp recordings were made.
!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = We used a dual reporter mouse line expressing discosoma red fluorescent protein (DsRed) under regulatory elements of the cholecystokinin promoter and green fluorescent protein (GFP) knocked into  the glutamate decarboxylase 67 gene .  Animals were group-housed under 12:12 h/h  light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to water and food. Animals of both sexes were used  for neurophysiology experiments during postnatal days 17-23.
!Sample_molecule_ch1 = polyA RNA
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = At the end of each patch-clamp protocol, the micropipette was clamped to a holding potential. The entire soma of each recorded neuron was aspirated into the micropipette slowly by applying negative pressure, and ejected into a drop of lysis buffer.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = 20 microL lysis buffer (0.15% Triton X-100, 1 U/microL TaKaRa RNase inhibitor, 4 microM reverse transcription primer C1-P1-T31, 5% C1 Loading Reagent and 1:50,000 Life Technologies ERCC  Spike-In Mix 1), reverse transcription mix (1x SuperScript II First-Strand Buffer supplemented with 3 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM dNTP, 4 mM DTT, 3.3% C1 Loading Reagent, 1.8 microM template-switching oligo C1-P1-RNA-TSO, 1.5 U/microL TaKaRa RNase inhibitor and 18 U/microL Life Technologies Superscript II reverse transcriptase) and PCR mix (1.1x Clontech Advantage2 PCR buffer, 440 microM dNTP, 530 nM PCR primer C1-P1-PCR-2, 5% C1 Loading Reagent and 2x Advantage2 Polymerase Mix) were added to the designated wells according to the manufacturer's instructions, but using the indicated mixes in place of the corresponding commmercial reagents. The plate was then returned to the Fluidigm C1 and the mRNA Seq: RT + Amp (1772x/1773x) script was executed, which took about 8.5 hours and included lysis, reverse transcription and 21 cycles of PCR. When the run finished, the amplified cDNA was harvested in a total of 13 microL C1 Harvesting Reagent and quantified on an Agilent BioAnalyzer. The typical yield was 1 ng/microL. Amplified cDNA was simultaneously fragmented and barcoded by tagmentation, i.e. using Tn5 DNA transposase to transfer adapters to the target DNA. 96 different 10x transposome stocks (6.25 microM barcoded adapter C1-TN5-x, 40% glycerol, 6.25 microM Tn5 transposase, where x denotes a well-specific barcode) were prepared, each with a different barcode sequence.  6 microL harvested cDNA was mixed with 5 microL tagmentation buffer (50 mM TAPS-NaOH pH 8.5, 25 mM MgCl2 and 50% DMF), 11.5 microL nuclease-free water and 2.5 microL 10x transposome stock. The mix was incubated for 5 minutes at 55 degeees C then cooled on ice. 100 microL Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 beads were washed in 2xBWT (10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 2 M NaCl, 0.02% Tween-20) then resuspended in 2 mL 2xBWT. 20 microL beads was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. All fractions were pooled, the beads were immobilized and the supernatant removed (thus removing all internal fragments, and retaining only the 5'- and 3'-most fragments). The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL TNT (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.02% Tween), washed in 100 microL Qiagen Qiaquick PB, then twice in 100 microL TNT. The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL restriction mix (1x NEB NEBuffer 4, 0.4 U/microL PvuI-HF enzyme), designed to cleave 3' fragments carrying the PvuI recognition site. The mix was incubated for one hour at 37 degrees C, then washed three times in TNT. Finally, the single-stranded library was eluted by resuspending the beads in 100 microL 100 mM NaOH, incubating for 5 minutes, removing the beads, then adding 100 microL 100 mM HCl and 50 microL Neutralization buffer (200 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween-20). At this point, the typical yield was 1-5 nM single-stranded library. Aliquots were rom these were run on  with 187ds_).
!Sample_data_processing = Read quality filtering and barcode extraction: Every read that was considered valid by the Illumina HiSeq control software was processed and filtered as follows: a) any 3' bases with a quality score of 'B' were removed; b) the well-identifying barcode was extracted from the 5' end of the read; c) if the read ended in a poly(A)-sequence leaving less than 25 transcript-derived bases, the read was discarded; d) the 8-base UMI was extracted from the 5' end and if any of the UMI bases had a Phred score less than 17 the read was discarded; e) a maximum of nine template-switching generated Gs were removed from the 5' end of the transcript-derived sequence; f) if the remaining sequence consisted of less than six non-A bases, or a dinucleotide repeat with less than six other bases at either end, the read was discarded.
!Sample_data_processing = Alignment:the reads were aligned to the genome using the Bowtie aligner, allowing for up to three mismatches and up to 24 alternative mappings for each read. The genome included an artifical chromosome, containing a concatamer of the ERCC control sequences. Any reads with no alignments were re-aligned against another artifical chromosome, containing all possible splice junctions arising from the exons defined by the known transcript variants. Reads mapping within these splice junctions were translated back to the corresponding actual genomic positions. The UCSC transcript models22 were used for the expression level calculation. If a locus had several transcript variants, the exons of these were merged to a combined model that represented all expression from the locus. To account for incompete cap site knowledge, the 5' ends of all models were extended by 100 bases, but not beyond the 3' end of any upstream nearby exon of another gene of the same orientation.
!Sample_data_processing = Annotation and quantitation: The annotation step was performed barcode-by-barcode. For every unique mapping (genomic position and strand) the number of reads in each UMI was counted. Any multiread that had one or more repeat mappings that was outside exons, was assigned randomly as one of these repeats and contributed to the summarized read count of that repeat class. Else, if it had one or more mappings to exons, it was assigned at the exon where it was closest to the transcript model 5' end, even if the sequence was repeat-like. If it had no exon mapping, it was assigned randomly at one of the mappings. After assigning reads, the number of molecules at each mapping position was determined by the number of distinct UMIs observed. To account for UMIs that stem from PCR-induced mutations or sequencing errors, any UMI that had fewer reads than 1/100 of the average of the non-zero UMIs was excluded. The raw UMI count was corrected for the UMI collision probability (important only at high UMI counts) as described10. The expression level of each transcript model was taken as the total number of molecules at all its possible mapping positions.

Neurons were visualized by differential interference contrast microscopy and co-existence of DsRed and GFP in interneurons was confirmed by epifluorescence microsopy, and whole-cell patch clamp recordings were made.
!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = We used a dual reporter mouse line expressing discosoma red fluorescent protein (DsRed) under regulatory elements of the cholecystokinin promoter and green fluorescent protein (GFP) knocked into  the glutamate decarboxylase 67 gene .  Animals were group-housed under 12:12 h/h  light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to water and food. Animals of both sexes were used  for neurophysiology experiments during postnatal days 17-23.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = At the end of each patch-clamp protocol, the micropipette was clamped to a holding potential. The entire soma of each recorded neuron was aspirated into the micropipette slowly by applying negative pressure, and ejected into a drop of lysis buffer.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = 20 microL lysis buffer (0.15% Triton X-100, 1 U/microL TaKaRa RNase inhibitor, 4 microM reverse transcription primer C1-P1-T31, 5% C1 Loading Reagent and 1:50,000 Life Technologies ERCC  Spike-In Mix 1), reverse transcription mix (1x SuperScript II First-Strand Buffer supplemented with 3 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM dNTP, 4 mM DTT, 3.3% C1 Loading Reagent, 1.8 microM template-switching oligo C1-P1-RNA-TSO, 1.5 U/microL TaKaRa RNase inhibitor and 18 U/microL Life Technologies Superscript II reverse transcriptase) and PCR mix (1.1x Clontech Advantage2 PCR buffer, 440 microM dNTP, 530 nM PCR primer C1-P1-PCR-2, 5% C1 Loading Reagent and 2x Advantage2 Polymerase Mix) were added to the designated wells according to the manufacturer's instructions, but using the indicated mixes in place of the corresponding commmercial reagents. The plate was then returned to the Fluidigm C1 and the mRNA Seq: RT + Amp (1772x/1773x) script was executed, which took about 8.5 hours and included lysis, reverse transcription and 21 cycles of PCR. When the run finished, the amplified cDNA was harvested in a total of 13 microL C1 Harvesting Reagent and quantified on an Agilent BioAnalyzer. The typical yield was 1 ng/microL. Amplified cDNA was simultaneously fragmented and barcoded by tagmentation, i.e. using Tn5 DNA transposase to transfer adapters to the target DNA. 96 different 10x transposome stocks (6.25 microM barcoded adapter C1-TN5-x, 40% glycerol, 6.25 microM Tn5 transposase, where x denotes a well-specific barcode) were prepared, each with a different barcode sequence.  6 microL harvested cDNA was mixed with 5 microL tagmentation buffer (50 mM TAPS-NaOH pH 8.5, 25 mM MgCl2 and 50% DMF), 11.5 microL nuclease-free water and 2.5 microL 10x transposome stock. The mix was incubated for 5 minutes at 55 degeees C then cooled on ice. 100 microL Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 beads were washed in 2xBWT (10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 2 M NaCl, 0.02% Tween-20) then resuspended in 2 mL 2xBWT. 20 microL beads was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. All fractions were pooled, the beads were immobilized and the supernatant removed (thus removing all internal fragments, and retaining only the 5'- and 3'-most fragments). The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL TNT (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.02% Tween), washed in 100 microL Qiagen Qiaquick PB, then twice in 100 microL TNT. The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL restriction mix (1x NEB NEBuffer 4, 0.4 U/microL PvuI-HF enzyme), designed to cleave 3' fragments carrying the PvuI recognition site. The mix was incubated for one hour at 37 degrees C, then washed three times in TNT. Finally, the single-stranded library was eluted by resuspending the beads in 100 microL 100 mM NaOH, incubating for 5 minutes, removing the beads, then adding 100 microL 100 mM HCl and 50 microL Neutralization buffer (200 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween-20). At this point, the typical yield was 1-5 nM single-stranded library. Aliquots were rom these were run on  with 187ds_).
!Sample_data_processing = Read quality filtering and barcode extraction: Every read that was considered valid by the Illumina HiSeq control software was processed and filtered as follows: a) any 3' bases with a quality score of 'B' were removed; b) the well-identifying barcode was extracted from the 5' end of the read; c) if the read ended in a poly(A)-sequence leaving less than 25 transcript-derived bases, the read was discarded; d) the 8-base UMI was extracted from the 5' end and if any of the UMI bases had a Phred score less than 17 the read was discarded; e) a maximum of nine template-switching generated Gs were removed from the 5' end of the transcript-derived sequence; f) if the remaining sequence consisted of less than six non-A bases, or a dinucleotide repeat with less than six other bases at either end, the read was discarded.
!Sample_data_processing = Alignment:the reads were aligned to the genome using the Bowtie aligner, allowing for up to three mismatches and up to 24 alternative mappings for each read. The genome included an artifical chromosome, containing a concatamer of the ERCC control sequences. Any reads with no alignments were re-aligned against another artifical chromosome, containing all possible splice junctions arising from the exons defined by the known transcript variants. Reads mapping within these splice junctions were translated back to the corresponding actual genomic positions. The UCSC transcript models22 were used for the expression level calculation. If a locus had several transcript variants, the exons of these were merged to a combined model that represented all expression from the locus. To account for incompete cap site knowledge, the 5' ends of all models were extended by 100 bases, but not beyond the 3' end of any upstream nearby exon of another gene of the same orientation.
!Sample_data_processing = Annotation and quantitation: The annotation step was performed barcode-by-barcode. For every unique mapping (genomic position and strand) the number of reads in each UMI was counted. Any multiread that had one or more repeat mappings that was outside exons, was assigned randomly as one of these repeats and contributed to the summarized read count of that repeat class. Else, if it had one or more mappings to exons, it was assigned at the exon where it was closest to the transcript model 5' end, even if the sequence was repeat-like. If it had no exon mapping, it was assigned randomly at one of the mappings. After assigning reads, the number of molecules at each mapping position was determined by the number of distinct UMIs observed. To account for UMIs that stem from PCR-induced mutations or sequencing errors, any UMI that had fewer reads than 1/100 of the average of the non-zero UMIs was excluded. The raw UMI count was corrected for the UMI collision probability (important only at high UMI counts) as described10. The expression level of each transcript model was taken as the total number of molecules at all its possible mapping positions.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = 20 microL lysis buffer (0.15% Triton X-100, 1 U/microL TaKaRa RNase inhibitor, 4 microM reverse transcription primer C1-P1-T31, 5% C1 Loading Reagent and 1:50,000 Life Technologies ERCC  Spike-In Mix 1), reverse transcription mix (1x SuperScript II First-Strand Buffer supplemented with 3 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM dNTP, 4 mM DTT, 3.3% C1 Loading Reagent, 1.8 microM template-switching oligo C1-P1-RNA-TSO, 1.5 U/microL TaKaRa RNase inhibitor and 18 U/microL Life Technologies Superscript II reverse transcriptase) and PCR mix (1.1x Clontech Advantage2 PCR buffer, 440 microM dNTP, 530 nM PCR primer C1-P1-PCR-2, 5% C1 Loading Reagent and 2x Advantage2 Polymerase Mix) were added to the designated wells according to the manufacturer's instructions, but using the indicated mixes in place of the corresponding commmercial reagents. The plate was then returned to the Fluidigm C1 and the mRNA Seq: RT + Amp (1772x/1773x) script was executed, which took about 8.5 hours and included lysis, reverse transcription and 21 cycles of PCR. When the run finished, the amplified cDNA was harvested in a total of 13 microL C1 Harvesting Reagent and quantified on an Agilent BioAnalyzer. The typical yield was 1 ng/microL. Amplified cDNA was simultaneously fragmented and barcoded by tagmentation, i.e. using Tn5 DNA transposase to transfer adapters to the target DNA. 96 different 10x transposome stocks (6.25 microM barcoded adapter C1-TN5-x, 40% glycerol, 6.25 microM Tn5 transposase, where x denotes a well-specific barcode) were prepared, each with a different barcode sequence.  6 microL harvested cDNA was mixed with 5 microL tagmentation buffer (50 mM TAPS-NaOH pH 8.5, 25 mM MgCl2 and 50% DMF), 11.5 microL nuclease-free water and 2.5 microL 10x transposome stock. The mix was incubated for 5 minutes at 55 degeees C then cooled on ice. 100 microL Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 beads were washed in 2xBWT (10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 2 M NaCl, 0.02% Tween-20) then resuspended in 2 mL 2xBWT. 20 microL beads was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. All fractions were pooled, the beads were immobilized and the supernatant removed (thus removing all internal fragments, and retaining only the 5'- and 3'-most fragments). The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL TNT (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.02% Tween), washed in 100 microL Qiagen Qiaquick PB, then twice in 100 microL TNT. The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL restriction mix (1x NEB NEBuffer 4, 0.4 U/microL PvuI-HF enzyme), designed to cleave 3' fragments carrying the PvuI recognition site. The mix was incubated for one hour at 37 degrees C, then washed three times in TNT. Finally, the single-stranded library was eluted by resuspending the beads in 100 microL 100 mM NaOH, incubating for 5 minutes, removing the beads, then adding 100 microL 100 mM HCl and 50 microL Neutralization buffer (200 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween-20). At this point, the typical yield was 1-5 nM single-stranded library. Aliquots were rom these were run on  with 187ds_).
!Sample_data_processing = Read quality filtering and barcode extraction: Every read that was considered valid by the Illumina HiSeq control software was processed and filtered as follows: a) any 3' bases with a quality score of 'B' were removed; b) the well-identifying barcode was extracted from the 5' end of the read; c) if the read ended in a poly(A)-sequence leaving less than 25 transcript-derived bases, the read was discarded; d) the 8-base UMI was extracted from the 5' end and if any of the UMI bases had a Phred score less than 17 the read was discarded; e) a maximum of nine template-switching generated Gs were removed from the 5' end of the transcript-derived sequence; f) if the remaining sequence consisted of less than six non-A bases, or a dinucleotide repeat with less than six other bases at either end, the read was discarded.
!Sample_data_processing = Alignment:the reads were aligned to the genome using the Bowtie aligner, allowing for up to three mismatches and up to 24 alternative mappings for each read. The genome included an artifical chromosome, containing a concatamer of the ERCC control sequences. Any reads with no alignments were re-aligned against another artifical chromosome, containing all possible splice junctions arising from the exons defined by the known transcript variants. Reads mapping within these splice junctions were translated back to the corresponding actual genomic positions. The UCSC transcript models22 were used for the expression level calculation. If a locus had several transcript variants, the exons of these were merged to a combined model that represented all expression from the locus. To account for incompete cap site knowledge, the 5' ends of all models were extended by 100 bases, but not beyond the 3' end of any upstream nearby exon of another gene of the same orientation.
!Sample_data_processing = Annotation and quantitation: The annotation step was performed barcode-by-barcode. For every unique mapping (genomic position and strand) the number of reads in each UMI was counted. Any multiread that had one or more repeat mappings that was outside exons, was assigned randomly as one of these repeats and contributed to the summarized read count of that repeat class. Else, if it had one or more mappings to exons, it was assigned at the exon where it was closest to the transcript model 5' end, even if the sequence was repeat-like. If it had no exon mapping, it was assigned randomly at one of the mappings. After assigning reads, the number of molecules at each mapping position was determined by the number of distinct UMIs observed. To account for UMIs that stem from PCR-induced mutations or sequencing errors, any UMI that had fewer reads than 1/100 of the average of the non-zero UMIs was excluded. The raw UMI count was corrected for the UMI collision probability (important only at high UMI counts) as described10. The expression level of each transcript model was taken as the total number of molecules at all its possible mapping positions.

When the run finished, the amplified cDNA was harvested in a total of 13 microL C1 Harvesting Reagent and quantified on an Agilent BioAnalyzer. The typical yield was 1 ng/microL. Amplified cDNA was simultaneously fragmented and barcoded by tagmentation, i.e. using Tn5 DNA transposase to transfer adapters to the target DNA. 96 different 10x transposome stocks (6.25 microM barcoded adapter C1-TN5-x, 40% glycerol, 6.25 microM Tn5 transposase, where x denotes a well-specific barcode) were prepared, each with a different barcode sequence.  6 microL harvested cDNA was mixed with 5 microL tagmentation buffer (50 mM TAPS-NaOH pH 8.5, 25 mM MgCl2 and 50% DMF), 11.5 microL nuclease-free water and 2.5 microL 10x transposome stock. The mix was incubated for 5 minutes at 55 degeees C then cooled on ice. 100 microL Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 beads were washed in 2xBWT (10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 2 M NaCl, 0.02% Tween-20) then resuspended in 2 mL 2xBWT. 20 microL beads was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. All fractions were pooled, the beads were immobilized and the supernatant removed (thus removing all internal fragments, and retaining only the 5'- and 3'-most fragments). The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL TNT (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.02% Tween), washed in 100 microL Qiagen Qiaquick PB, then twice in 100 microL TNT. The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL restriction mix (1x NEB NEBuffer 4, 0.4 U/microL PvuI-HF enzyme), designed to cleave 3' fragments carrying the PvuI recognition site. The mix was incubated for one hour at 37 degrees C, then washed three times in TNT. Finally, the single-stranded library was eluted by resuspending the beads in 100 microL 100 mM NaOH, incubating for 5 minutes, removing the beads, then adding 100 microL 100 mM HCl and 50 microL Neutralization buffer (200 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween-20). At this point, the typical yield was 1-5 nM single-stranded library. Aliquots were rom these were run on  with 187ds_).
!Sample_data_processing = Read quality filtering and barcode extraction: Every read that was considered valid by the Illumina HiSeq control software was processed and filtered as follows: a) any 3' bases with a quality score of 'B' were removed; b) the well-identifying barcode was extracted from the 5' end of the read; c) if the read ended in a poly(A)-sequence leaving less than 25 transcript-derived bases, the read was discarded; d) the 8-base UMI was extracted from the 5' end and if any of the UMI bases had a Phred score less than 17 the read was discarded; e) a maximum of nine template-switching generated Gs were removed from the 5' end of the transcript-derived sequence; f) if the remaining sequence consisted of less than six non-A bases, or a dinucleotide repeat with less than six other bases at either end, the read was discarded.
!Sample_data_processing = Alignment:the reads were aligned to the genome using the Bowtie aligner, allowing for up to three mismatches and up to 24 alternative mappings for each read. The genome included an artifical chromosome, containing a concatamer of the ERCC control sequences. Any reads with no alignments were re-aligned against another artifical chromosome, containing all possible splice junctions arising from the exons defined by the known transcript variants. Reads mapping within these splice junctions were translated back to the corresponding actual genomic positions. The UCSC transcript models22 were used for the expression level calculation. If a locus had several transcript variants, the exons of these were merged to a combined model that represented all expression from the locus. To account for incompete cap site knowledge, the 5' ends of all models were extended by 100 bases, but not beyond the 3' end of any upstream nearby exon of another gene of the same orientation.
!Sample_data_processing = Annotation and quantitation: The annotation step was performed barcode-by-barcode. For every unique mapping (genomic position and strand) the number of reads in each UMI was counted. Any multiread that had one or more repeat mappings that was outside exons, was assigned randomly as one of these repeats and contributed to the summarized read count of that repeat class. Else, if it had one or more mappings to exons, it was assigned at the exon where it was closest to the transcript model 5' end, even if the sequence was repeat-like. If it had no exon mapping, it was assigned randomly at one of the mappings. After assigning reads, the number of molecules at each mapping position was determined by the number of distinct UMIs observed. To account for UMIs that stem from PCR-induced mutations or sequencing errors, any UMI that had fewer reads than 1/100 of the average of the non-zero UMIs was excluded. The raw UMI count was corrected for the UMI collision probability (important only at high UMI counts) as described10. The expression level of each transcript model was taken as the total number of molecules at all its possible mapping positions.

Amplified cDNA was simultaneously fragmented and barcoded by tagmentation, i.e. using Tn5 DNA transposase to transfer adapters to the target DNA. 96 different 10x transposome stocks (6.25 microM barcoded adapter C1-TN5-x, 40% glycerol, 6.25 microM Tn5 transposase, where x denotes a well-specific barcode) were prepared, each with a different barcode sequence.  6 microL harvested cDNA was mixed with 5 microL tagmentation buffer (50 mM TAPS-NaOH pH 8.5, 25 mM MgCl2 and 50% DMF), 11.5 microL nuclease-free water and 2.5 microL 10x transposome stock. The mix was incubated for 5 minutes at 55 degeees C then cooled on ice. 100 microL Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 beads were washed in 2xBWT (10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 2 M NaCl, 0.02% Tween-20) then resuspended in 2 mL 2xBWT. 20 microL beads was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. All fractions were pooled, the beads were immobilized and the supernatant removed (thus removing all internal fragments, and retaining only the 5'- and 3'-most fragments). The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL TNT (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.02% Tween), washed in 100 microL Qiagen Qiaquick PB, then twice in 100 microL TNT. The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL restriction mix (1x NEB NEBuffer 4, 0.4 U/microL PvuI-HF enzyme), designed to cleave 3' fragments carrying the PvuI recognition site. The mix was incubated for one hour at 37 degrees C, then washed three times in TNT. Finally, the single-stranded library was eluted by resuspending the beads in 100 microL 100 mM NaOH, incubating for 5 minutes, removing the beads, then adding 100 microL 100 mM HCl and 50 microL Neutralization buffer (200 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween-20). At this point, the typical yield was 1-5 nM single-stranded library. Aliquots were rom these were run on  with 187ds_).
!Sample_data_processing = Read quality filtering and barcode extraction: Every read that was considered valid by the Illumina HiSeq control software was processed and filtered as follows: a) any 3' bases with a quality score of 'B' were removed; b) the well-identifying barcode was extracted from the 5' end of the read; c) if the read ended in a poly(A)-sequence leaving less than 25 transcript-derived bases, the read was discarded; d) the 8-base UMI was extracted from the 5' end and if any of the UMI bases had a Phred score less than 17 the read was discarded; e) a maximum of nine template-switching generated Gs were removed from the 5' end of the transcript-derived sequence; f) if the remaining sequence consisted of less than six non-A bases, or a dinucleotide repeat with less than six other bases at either end, the read was discarded.
!Sample_data_processing = Alignment:the reads were aligned to the genome using the Bowtie aligner, allowing for up to three mismatches and up to 24 alternative mappings for each read. The genome included an artifical chromosome, containing a concatamer of the ERCC control sequences. Any reads with no alignments were re-aligned against another artifical chromosome, containing all possible splice junctions arising from the exons defined by the known transcript variants. Reads mapping within these splice junctions were translated back to the corresponding actual genomic positions. The UCSC transcript models22 were used for the expression level calculation. If a locus had several transcript variants, the exons of these were merged to a combined model that represented all expression from the locus. To account for incompete cap site knowledge, the 5' ends of all models were extended by 100 bases, but not beyond the 3' end of any upstream nearby exon of another gene of the same orientation.
!Sample_data_processing = Annotation and quantitation: The annotation step was performed barcode-by-barcode. For every unique mapping (genomic position and strand) the number of reads in each UMI was counted. Any multiread that had one or more repeat mappings that was outside exons, was assigned randomly as one of these repeats and contributed to the summarized read count of that repeat class. Else, if it had one or more mappings to exons, it was assigned at the exon where it was closest to the transcript model 5' end, even if the sequence was repeat-like. If it had no exon mapping, it was assigned randomly at one of the mappings. After assigning reads, the number of molecules at each mapping position was determined by the number of distinct UMIs observed. To account for UMIs that stem from PCR-induced mutations or sequencing errors, any UMI that had fewer reads than 1/100 of the average of the non-zero UMIs was excluded. The raw UMI count was corrected for the UMI collision probability (important only at high UMI counts) as described10. The expression level of each transcript model was taken as the total number of molecules at all its possible mapping positions.

All fractions were pooled, the beads were immobilized and the supernatant removed (thus removing all internal fragments, and retaining only the 5'- and 3'-most fragments). The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL TNT (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.02% Tween), washed in 100 microL Qiagen Qiaquick PB, then twice in 100 microL TNT. The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL restriction mix (1x NEB NEBuffer 4, 0.4 U/microL PvuI-HF enzyme), designed to cleave 3' fragments carrying the PvuI recognition site. The mix was incubated for one hour at 37 degrees C, then washed three times in TNT. Finally, the single-stranded library was eluted by resuspending the beads in 100 microL 100 mM NaOH, incubating for 5 minutes, removing the beads, then adding 100 microL 100 mM HCl and 50 microL Neutralization buffer (200 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween-20). At this point, the typical yield was 1-5 nM single-stranded library. Aliquots were rom these were run on  with 187ds_).
!Sample_data_processing = Read quality filtering and barcode extraction: Every read that was considered valid by the Illumina HiSeq control software was processed and filtered as follows: a) any 3' bases with a quality score of 'B' were removed; b) the well-identifying barcode was extracted from the 5' end of the read; c) if the read ended in a poly(A)-sequence leaving less than 25 transcript-derived bases, the read was discarded; d) the 8-base UMI was extracted from the 5' end and if any of the UMI bases had a Phred score less than 17 the read was discarded; e) a maximum of nine template-switching generated Gs were removed from the 5' end of the transcript-derived sequence; f) if the remaining sequence consisted of less than six non-A bases, or a dinucleotide repeat with less than six other bases at either end, the read was discarded.
!Sample_data_processing = Alignment:the reads were aligned to the genome using the Bowtie aligner, allowing for up to three mismatches and up to 24 alternative mappings for each read. The genome included an artifical chromosome, containing a concatamer of the ERCC control sequences. Any reads with no alignments were re-aligned against another artifical chromosome, containing all possible splice junctions arising from the exons defined by the known transcript variants. Reads mapping within these splice junctions were translated back to the corresponding actual genomic positions. The UCSC transcript models22 were used for the expression level calculation. If a locus had several transcript variants, the exons of these were merged to a combined model that represented all expression from the locus. To account for incompete cap site knowledge, the 5' ends of all models were extended by 100 bases, but not beyond the 3' end of any upstream nearby exon of another gene of the same orientation.
!Sample_data_processing = Annotation and quantitation: The annotation step was performed barcode-by-barcode. For every unique mapping (genomic position and strand) the number of reads in each UMI was counted. Any multiread that had one or more repeat mappings that was outside exons, was assigned randomly as one of these repeats and contributed to the summarized read count of that repeat class. Else, if it had one or more mappings to exons, it was assigned at the exon where it was closest to the transcript model 5' end, even if the sequence was repeat-like. If it had no exon mapping, it was assigned randomly at one of the mappings. After assigning reads, the number of molecules at each mapping position was determined by the number of distinct UMIs observed. To account for UMIs that stem from PCR-induced mutations or sequencing errors, any UMI that had fewer reads than 1/100 of the average of the non-zero UMIs was excluded. The raw UMI count was corrected for the UMI collision probability (important only at high UMI counts) as described10. The expression level of each transcript model was taken as the total number of molecules at all its possible mapping positions.

The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL restriction mix (1x NEB NEBuffer 4, 0.4 U/microL PvuI-HF enzyme), designed to cleave 3' fragments carrying the PvuI recognition site. The mix was incubated for one hour at 37 degrees C, then washed three times in TNT. Finally, the single-stranded library was eluted by resuspending the beads in 100 microL 100 mM NaOH, incubating for 5 minutes, removing the beads, then adding 100 microL 100 mM HCl and 50 microL Neutralization buffer (200 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween-20). At this point, the typical yield was 1-5 nM single-stranded library. Aliquots were rom these were run on  with 187ds_).
!Sample_data_processing = Read quality filtering and barcode extraction: Every read that was considered valid by the Illumina HiSeq control software was processed and filtered as follows: a) any 3' bases with a quality score of 'B' were removed; b) the well-identifying barcode was extracted from the 5' end of the read; c) if the read ended in a poly(A)-sequence leaving less than 25 transcript-derived bases, the read was discarded; d) the 8-base UMI was extracted from the 5' end and if any of the UMI bases had a Phred score less than 17 the read was discarded; e) a maximum of nine template-switching generated Gs were removed from the 5' end of the transcript-derived sequence; f) if the remaining sequence consisted of less than six non-A bases, or a dinucleotide repeat with less than six other bases at either end, the read was discarded.
!Sample_data_processing = Alignment:the reads were aligned to the genome using the Bowtie aligner, allowing for up to three mismatches and up to 24 alternative mappings for each read. The genome included an artifical chromosome, containing a concatamer of the ERCC control sequences. Any reads with no alignments were re-aligned against another artifical chromosome, containing all possible splice junctions arising from the exons defined by the known transcript variants. Reads mapping within these splice junctions were translated back to the corresponding actual genomic positions. The UCSC transcript models22 were used for the expression level calculation. If a locus had several transcript variants, the exons of these were merged to a combined model that represented all expression from the locus. To account for incompete cap site knowledge, the 5' ends of all models were extended by 100 bases, but not beyond the 3' end of any upstream nearby exon of another gene of the same orientation.
!Sample_data_processing = Annotation and quantitation: The annotation step was performed barcode-by-barcode. For every unique mapping (genomic position and strand) the number of reads in each UMI was counted. Any multiread that had one or more repeat mappings that was outside exons, was assigned randomly as one of these repeats and contributed to the summarized read count of that repeat class. Else, if it had one or more mappings to exons, it was assigned at the exon where it was closest to the transcript model 5' end, even if the sequence was repeat-like. If it had no exon mapping, it was assigned randomly at one of the mappings. After assigning reads, the number of molecules at each mapping position was determined by the number of distinct UMIs observed. To account for UMIs that stem from PCR-induced mutations or sequencing errors, any UMI that had fewer reads than 1/100 of the average of the non-zero UMIs was excluded. The raw UMI count was corrected for the UMI collision probability (important only at high UMI counts) as described10. The expression level of each transcript model was taken as the total number of molecules at all its possible mapping positions.

!Sample_data_processing = Read quality filtering and barcode extraction: Every read that was considered valid by the Illumina HiSeq control software was processed and filtered as follows: a) any 3' bases with a quality score of 'B' were removed; b) the well-identifying barcode was extracted from the 5' end of the read; c) if the read ended in a poly(A)-sequence leaving less than 25 transcript-derived bases, the read was discarded; d) the 8-base UMI was extracted from the 5' end and if any of the UMI bases had a Phred score less than 17 the read was discarded; e) a maximum of nine template-switching generated Gs were removed from the 5' end of the transcript-derived sequence; f) if the remaining sequence consisted of less than six non-A bases, or a dinucleotide repeat with less than six other bases at either end, the read was discarded.
!Sample_data_processing = Alignment:the reads were aligned to the genome using the Bowtie aligner, allowing for up to three mismatches and up to 24 alternative mappings for each read. The genome included an artifical chromosome, containing a concatamer of the ERCC control sequences. Any reads with no alignments were re-aligned against another artifical chromosome, containing all possible splice junctions arising from the exons defined by the known transcript variants. Reads mapping within these splice junctions were translated back to the corresponding actual genomic positions. The UCSC transcript models22 were used for the expression level calculation. If a locus had several transcript variants, the exons of these were merged to a combined model that represented all expression from the locus. To account for incompete cap site knowledge, the 5' ends of all models were extended by 100 bases, but not beyond the 3' end of any upstream nearby exon of another gene of the same orientation.
!Sample_data_processing = Annotation and quantitation: The annotation step was performed barcode-by-barcode. For every unique mapping (genomic position and strand) the number of reads in each UMI was counted. Any multiread that had one or more repeat mappings that was outside exons, was assigned randomly as one of these repeats and contributed to the summarized read count of that repeat class. Else, if it had one or more mappings to exons, it was assigned at the exon where it was closest to the transcript model 5' end, even if the sequence was repeat-like. If it had no exon mapping, it was assigned randomly at one of the mappings. After assigning reads, the number of molecules at each mapping position was determined by the number of distinct UMIs observed. To account for UMIs that stem from PCR-induced mutations or sequencing errors, any UMI that had fewer reads than 1/100 of the average of the non-zero UMIs was excluded. The raw UMI count was corrected for the UMI collision probability (important only at high UMI counts) as described10. The expression level of each transcript model was taken as the total number of molecules at all its possible mapping positions.

The plate was then returned to the Fluidigm C1 and the mRNA Seq: RT + Amp (1772x/1773x) script was executed, which took about 8.5 hours and included lysis, reverse transcription and 21 cycles of PCR. When the run finished, the amplified cDNA was harvested in a total of 13 microL C1 Harvesting Reagent and quantified on an Agilent BioAnalyzer. The typical yield was 1 ng/microL.

Any reads with no alignments were re-aligned against another artifical chromosome, containing all possible splice junctions arising from the exons defined by the known transcript variants. Reads mapping within these splice junctions were translated back to the corresponding actual genomic positions. The UCSC transcript models22 were used for the expression level calculation. If a locus had several transcript variants, the exons of these were merged to a combined model that represented all expression from the locus. To account for incompete cap site knowledge, the 5' ends of all models were extended by 100 bases, but not beyond the 3' end of any upstream nearby exon of another gene of the same orientation.
!Sample_data_processing = Annotation and quantitation: The annotation step was performed barcode-by-barcode. For every unique mapping (genomic position and strand) the number of reads in each UMI was counted. Any multiread that had one or more repeat mappings that was outside exons, was assigned randomly as one of these repeats and contributed to the summarized read count of that repeat class. Else, if it had one or more mappings to exons, it was assigned at the exon where it was closest to the transcript model 5' end, even if the sequence was repeat-like. If it had no exon mapping, it was assigned randomly at one of the mappings. After assigning reads, the number of molecules at each mapping position was determined by the number of distinct UMIs observed. To account for UMIs that stem from PCR-induced mutations or sequencing errors, any UMI that had fewer reads than 1/100 of the average of the non-zero UMIs was excluded. The raw UMI count was corrected for the UMI collision probability (important only at high UMI counts) as described10. The expression level of each transcript model was taken as the total number of molecules at all its possible mapping positions.

!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = We used a dual reporter mouse line expressing discosoma red fluorescent protein (DsRed) under regulatory elements of the cholecystokinin promoter and green fluorescent protein (GFP) knocked into  the glutamate decarboxylase 67 gene .  Animals were group-housed under 12:12 h/h  light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to water and food. Animals of both sexes were used  for neurophysiology experiments during postnatal days 17-23.

The plate was then returned to the Fluidigm C1 and the mRNA Seq: RT + Amp (1772x/1773x) script was executed, which took about 8.5 hours and included lysis, reverse transcription and 21 cycles of PCR. When the run finished, the amplified cDNA was harvested in a total of 13 microL C1 Harvesting Reagent and quantified on an Agilent BioAnalyzer. The typical yield was 1 ng/microL. Amplified cDNA was simultaneously fragmented and barcoded by tagmentation, i.e. using Tn5 DNA transposase to transfer adapters to the target DNA. 96 different 10x transposome stocks (6.25 microM barcoded adapter C1-TN5-x, 40% glycerol, 6.25 microM Tn5 transposase, where x denotes a well-specific barcode) were prepared, each with a different barcode sequence.  6 microL harvested cDNA was mixed with 5 microL tagmentation buffer (50 mM TAPS-NaOH pH 8.5, 25 mM MgCl2 and 50% DMF), 11.5 microL nuclease-free water and 2.5 microL 10x transposome stock.

All fractions were pooled, the beads were immobilized and the supernatant removed (thus removing all internal fragments, and retaining only the 5'- and 3'-most fragments). The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL TNT (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.02% Tween), washed in 100 microL Qiagen Qiaquick PB, then twice in 100 microL TNT. The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL restriction mix (1x NEB NEBuffer 4, 0.4 U/microL PvuI-HF enzyme), designed to cleave 3' fragments carrying the PvuI recognition site. The mix was incubated for one hour at 37 degrees C, then washed three times in TNT. Finally, the single-stranded library was eluted by resuspending the beads in 100 microL 100 mM NaOH, incubating for 5 minutes, removing the beads, then adding 100 microL 100 mM HCl and 50 microL Neutralization buffer (200 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween-20). At this point, the typical yield was 1-5 nM single-stranded library. Aliquots were rom these were run on  with 187ds_).

The raw UMI count was corrected for the UMI collision probability (important only at high UMI counts) as described10. The expression level of each transcript model was taken as the total number of molecules at all its possible mapping positions.

!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch1 = Coronal slices of primary somatosensory cortex were prepared in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Neurons were visualized by differential interference contrast microscopy and co-existence of DsRed and GFP in interneurons was confirmed by epifluorescence microsopy, and whole-cell patch clamp recordings were made.
!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = We used a dual reporter mouse line expressing discosoma red fluorescent protein (DsRed) under regulatory elements of the cholecystokinin promoter and green fluorescent protein (GFP) knocked into  the glutamate decarboxylase 67 gene .  Animals were group-housed under 12:12 h/h  light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to water and food. Animals of both sexes were used  for neurophysiology experiments during postnatal days 17-23.
!Sample_molecule_ch1 = polyA RNA
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = At the end of each patch-clamp protocol, the micropipette was clamped to a holding potential. The entire soma of each recorded neuron was aspirated into the micropipette slowly by applying negative pressure, and ejected into a drop of lysis buffer.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = 20 microL lysis buffer (0.15% Triton X-100, 1 U/microL TaKaRa RNase inhibitor, 4 microM reverse transcription primer C1-P1-T31, 5% C1 Loading Reagent and 1:50,000 Life Technologies ERCC  Spike-In Mix 1), reverse transcription mix (1x SuperScript II First-Strand Buffer supplemented with 3 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM dNTP, 4 mM DTT, 3.3% C1 Loading Reagent, 1.8 microM template-switching oligo C1-P1-RNA-TSO, 1.5 U/microL TaKaRa RNase inhibitor and 18 U/microL Life Technologies Superscript II reverse transcriptase) and PCR mix (1.1x Clontech Advantage2 PCR buffer, 440 microM dNTP, 530 nM PCR primer C1-P1-PCR-2, 5% C1 Loading Reagent and 2x Advantage2 Polymerase Mix) were added to the designated wells according to the manufacturer's instructions, but using the indicated mixes in place of the corresponding commmercial reagents. The plate was then returned to the Fluidigm C1 and the mRNA Seq: RT + Amp (1772x/1773x) script was executed, which took about 8.5 hours and included lysis, reverse transcription and 21 cycles of PCR. When the run finished, the amplified cDNA was harvested in a total of 13 microL C1 Harvesting Reagent and quantified on an Agilent BioAnalyzer. The typical yield was 1 ng/microL. Amplified cDNA was simultaneously fragmented and barcoded by tagmentation, i.e. using Tn5 DNA transposase to transfer adapters to the target DNA. 96 different 10x transposome stocks (6.25 microM barcoded adapter C1-TN5-x, 40% glycerol, 6.25 microM Tn5 transposase, where x denotes a well-specific barcode) were prepared, each with a different barcode sequence.  6 microL harvested cDNA was mixed with 5 microL tagmentation buffer (50 mM TAPS-NaOH pH 8.5, 25 mM MgCl2 and 50% DMF), 11.5 microL nuclease-free water and 2.5 microL 10x transposome stock. The mix was incubated for 5 minutes at 55 degeees C then cooled on ice. 100 microL Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 beads were washed in 2xBWT (10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 2 M NaCl, 0.02% Tween-20) then resuspended in 2 mL 2xBWT. 20 microL beads was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. All fractions were pooled, the beads were immobilized and the supernatant removed (thus removing all internal fragments, and retaining only the 5'- and 3'-most fragments). The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL TNT (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.02% Tween), washed in 100 microL Qiagen Qiaquick PB, then twice in 100 microL TNT. The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL restriction mix (1x NEB NEBuffer 4, 0.4 U/microL PvuI-HF enzyme), designed to cleave 3' fragments carrying the PvuI recognition site. The mix was incubated for one hour at 37 degrees C, then washed three times in TNT. Finally, the single-stranded library was eluted by resuspending the beads in 100 microL 100 mM NaOH, incubating for 5 minutes, removing the beads, then adding 100 microL 100 mM HCl and 50 microL Neutralization buffer (200 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween-20). At this point, the typical yield was 1-5 nM single-stranded library. Aliquots were rom these were run on  with 187ds_).
!Sample_data_processing = Read quality filtering and barcode extraction: Every read that was considered valid by the Illumina HiSeq control software was processed and filtered as follows: a) any 3' bases with a quality score of 'B' were removed; b) the well-identifying barcode was extracted from the 5' end of the read; c) if the read ended in a poly(A)-sequence leaving less than 25 transcript-derived bases, the read was discarded; d) the 8-base UMI was extracted from the 5' end and if any of the UMI bases had a Phred score less than 17 the read was discarded; e) a maximum of nine template-switching generated Gs were removed from the 5' end of the transcript-derived sequence; f) if the remaining sequence consisted of less than six non-A bases, or a dinucleotide repeat with less than six other bases at either end, the read was discarded.
!Sample_data_processing = Alignment:the reads were aligned to the genome using the Bowtie aligner, allowing for up to three mismatches and up to 24 alternative mappings for each read. The genome included an artifical chromosome, containing a concatamer of the ERCC control sequences. Any reads with no alignments were re-aligned against another artifical chromosome, containing all possible splice junctions arising from the exons defined by the known transcript variants. Reads mapping within these splice junctions were translated back to the corresponding actual genomic positions. The UCSC transcript models22 were used for the expression level calculation. If a locus had several transcript variants, the exons of these were merged to a combined model that represented all expression from the locus. To account for incompete cap site knowledge, the 5' ends of all models were extended by 100 bases, but not beyond the 3' end of any upstream nearby exon of another gene of the same orientation.
!Sample_data_processing = Annotation and quantitation: The annotation step was performed barcode-by-barcode. For every unique mapping (genomic position and strand) the number of reads in each UMI was counted. Any multiread that had one or more repeat mappings that was outside exons, was assigned randomly as one of these repeats and contributed to the summarized read count of that repeat class. Else, if it had one or more mappings to exons, it was assigned at the exon where it was closest to the transcript model 5' end, even if the sequence was repeat-like. If it had no exon mapping, it was assigned randomly at one of the mappings. After assigning reads, the number of molecules at each mapping position was determined by the number of distinct UMIs observed.

Neurons were visualized by differential interference contrast microscopy and co-existence of DsRed and GFP in interneurons was confirmed by epifluorescence microsopy, and whole-cell patch clamp recordings were made.
!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = We used a dual reporter mouse line expressing discosoma red fluorescent protein (DsRed) under regulatory elements of the cholecystokinin promoter and green fluorescent protein (GFP) knocked into  the glutamate decarboxylase 67 gene .  Animals were group-housed under 12:12 h/h  light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to water and food. Animals of both sexes were used  for neurophysiology experiments during postnatal days 17-23.
!Sample_molecule_ch1 = polyA RNA
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = At the end of each patch-clamp protocol, the micropipette was clamped to a holding potential. The entire soma of each recorded neuron was aspirated into the micropipette slowly by applying negative pressure, and ejected into a drop of lysis buffer.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = 20 microL lysis buffer (0.15% Triton X-100, 1 U/microL TaKaRa RNase inhibitor, 4 microM reverse transcription primer C1-P1-T31, 5% C1 Loading Reagent and 1:50,000 Life Technologies ERCC  Spike-In Mix 1), reverse transcription mix (1x SuperScript II First-Strand Buffer supplemented with 3 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM dNTP, 4 mM DTT, 3.3% C1 Loading Reagent, 1.8 microM template-switching oligo C1-P1-RNA-TSO, 1.5 U/microL TaKaRa RNase inhibitor and 18 U/microL Life Technologies Superscript II reverse transcriptase) and PCR mix (1.1x Clontech Advantage2 PCR buffer, 440 microM dNTP, 530 nM PCR primer C1-P1-PCR-2, 5% C1 Loading Reagent and 2x Advantage2 Polymerase Mix) were added to the designated wells according to the manufacturer's instructions, but using the indicated mixes in place of the corresponding commmercial reagents. The plate was then returned to the Fluidigm C1 and the mRNA Seq: RT + Amp (1772x/1773x) script was executed, which took about 8.5 hours and included lysis, reverse transcription and 21 cycles of PCR. When the run finished, the amplified cDNA was harvested in a total of 13 microL C1 Harvesting Reagent and quantified on an Agilent BioAnalyzer. The typical yield was 1 ng/microL. Amplified cDNA was simultaneously fragmented and barcoded by tagmentation, i.e. using Tn5 DNA transposase to transfer adapters to the target DNA. 96 different 10x transposome stocks (6.25 microM barcoded adapter C1-TN5-x, 40% glycerol, 6.25 microM Tn5 transposase, where x denotes a well-specific barcode) were prepared, each with a different barcode sequence.  6 microL harvested cDNA was mixed with 5 microL tagmentation buffer (50 mM TAPS-NaOH pH 8.5, 25 mM MgCl2 and 50% DMF), 11.5 microL nuclease-free water and 2.5 microL 10x transposome stock. The mix was incubated for 5 minutes at 55 degeees C then cooled on ice. 100 microL Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 beads were washed in 2xBWT (10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 2 M NaCl, 0.02% Tween-20) then resuspended in 2 mL 2xBWT. 20 microL beads was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. All fractions were pooled, the beads were immobilized and the supernatant removed (thus removing all internal fragments, and retaining only the 5'- and 3'-most fragments). The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL TNT (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.02% Tween), washed in 100 microL Qiagen Qiaquick PB, then twice in 100 microL TNT. The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL restriction mix (1x NEB NEBuffer 4, 0.4 U/microL PvuI-HF enzyme), designed to cleave 3' fragments carrying the PvuI recognition site. The mix was incubated for one hour at 37 degrees C, then washed three times in TNT. Finally, the single-stranded library was eluted by resuspending the beads in 100 microL 100 mM NaOH, incubating for 5 minutes, removing the beads, then adding 100 microL 100 mM HCl and 50 microL Neutralization buffer (200 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween-20). At this point, the typical yield was 1-5 nM single-stranded library. Aliquots were rom these were run on  with 187ds_).
!Sample_data_processing = Read quality filtering and barcode extraction: Every read that was considered valid by the Illumina HiSeq control software was processed and filtered as follows: a) any 3' bases with a quality score of 'B' were removed; b) the well-identifying barcode was extracted from the 5' end of the read; c) if the read ended in a poly(A)-sequence leaving less than 25 transcript-derived bases, the read was discarded; d) the 8-base UMI was extracted from the 5' end and if any of the UMI bases had a Phred score less than 17 the read was discarded; e) a maximum of nine template-switching generated Gs were removed from the 5' end of the transcript-derived sequence; f) if the remaining sequence consisted of less than six non-A bases, or a dinucleotide repeat with less than six other bases at either end, the read was discarded.
!Sample_data_processing = Alignment:the reads were aligned to the genome using the Bowtie aligner, allowing for up to three mismatches and up to 24 alternative mappings for each read. The genome included an artifical chromosome, containing a concatamer of the ERCC control sequences. Any reads with no alignments were re-aligned against another artifical chromosome, containing all possible splice junctions arising from the exons defined by the known transcript variants. Reads mapping within these splice junctions were translated back to the corresponding actual genomic positions. The UCSC transcript models22 were used for the expression level calculation. If a locus had several transcript variants, the exons of these were merged to a combined model that represented all expression from the locus. To account for incompete cap site knowledge, the 5' ends of all models were extended by 100 bases, but not beyond the 3' end of any upstream nearby exon of another gene of the same orientation.
!Sample_data_processing = Annotation and quantitation: The annotation step was performed barcode-by-barcode. For every unique mapping (genomic position and strand) the number of reads in each UMI was counted. Any multiread that had one or more repeat mappings that was outside exons, was assigned randomly as one of these repeats and contributed to the summarized read count of that repeat class. Else, if it had one or more mappings to exons, it was assigned at the exon where it was closest to the transcript model 5' end, even if the sequence was repeat-like. If it had no exon mapping, it was assigned randomly at one of the mappings. After assigning reads, the number of molecules at each mapping position was determined by the number of distinct UMIs observed. To account for UMIs that stem from PCR-induced mutations or sequencing errors, any UMI that had fewer reads than 1/100 of the average of the non-zero UMIs was excluded. The raw UMI count was corrected for the UMI collision probability (important only at high UMI counts) as described10. The expression level of each transcript model was taken as the total number of molecules at all its possible mapping positions.

Neurons were visualized by differential interference contrast microscopy and co-existence of DsRed and GFP in interneurons was confirmed by epifluorescence microsopy, and whole-cell patch clamp recordings were made.
!Sample_growth_protocol_ch1 = We used a dual reporter mouse line expressing discosoma red fluorescent protein (DsRed) under regulatory elements of the cholecystokinin promoter and green fluorescent protein (GFP) knocked into  the glutamate decarboxylase 67 gene .  Animals were group-housed under 12:12 h/h  light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to water and food. Animals of both sexes were used  for neurophysiology experiments during postnatal days 17-23.
!Sample_molecule_ch1 = polyA RNA
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = At the end of each patch-clamp protocol, the micropipette was clamped to a holding potential. The entire soma of each recorded neuron was aspirated into the micropipette slowly by applying negative pressure, and ejected into a drop of lysis buffer.
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = 20 microL lysis buffer (0.15% Triton X-100, 1 U/microL TaKaRa RNase inhibitor, 4 microM reverse transcription primer C1-P1-T31, 5% C1 Loading Reagent and 1:50,000 Life Technologies ERCC  Spike-In Mix 1), reverse transcription mix (1x SuperScript II First-Strand Buffer supplemented with 3 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM dNTP, 4 mM DTT, 3.3% C1 Loading Reagent, 1.8 microM template-switching oligo C1-P1-RNA-TSO, 1.5 U/microL TaKaRa RNase inhibitor and 18 U/microL Life Technologies Superscript II reverse transcriptase) and PCR mix (1.1x Clontech Advantage2 PCR buffer, 440 microM dNTP, 530 nM PCR primer C1-P1-PCR-2, 5% C1 Loading Reagent and 2x Advantage2 Polymerase Mix) were added to the designated wells according to the manufacturer's instructions, but using the indicated mixes in place of the corresponding commmercial reagents. The plate was then returned to the Fluidigm C1 and the mRNA Seq: RT + Amp (1772x/1773x) script was executed, which took about 8.5 hours and included lysis, reverse transcription and 21 cycles of PCR. When the run finished, the amplified cDNA was harvested in a total of 13 microL C1 Harvesting Reagent and quantified on an Agilent BioAnalyzer. The typical yield was 1 ng/microL. Amplified cDNA was simultaneously fragmented and barcoded by tagmentation, i.e. using Tn5 DNA transposase to transfer adapters to the target DNA. 96 different 10x transposome stocks (6.25 microM barcoded adapter C1-TN5-x, 40% glycerol, 6.25 microM Tn5 transposase, where x denotes a well-specific barcode) were prepared, each with a different barcode sequence.  6 microL harvested cDNA was mixed with 5 microL tagmentation buffer (50 mM TAPS-NaOH pH 8.5, 25 mM MgCl2 and 50% DMF), 11.5 microL nuclease-free water and 2.5 microL 10x transposome stock. The mix was incubated for 5 minutes at 55 degeees C then cooled on ice. 100 microL Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 beads were washed in 2xBWT (10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 2 M NaCl, 0.02% Tween-20) then resuspended in 2 mL 2xBWT. 20 microL beads was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. All fractions were pooled, the beads were immobilized and the supernatant removed (thus removing all internal fragments, and retaining only the 5'- and 3'-most fragments). The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL TNT (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.02% Tween), washed in 100 microL Qiagen Qiaquick PB, then twice in 100 microL TNT. The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL restriction mix (1x NEB NEBuffer 4, 0.4 U/microL PvuI-HF enzyme), designed to cleave 3' fragments carrying the PvuI recognition site. The mix was incubated for one hour at 37 degrees C, then washed three times in TNT. Finally, the single-stranded library was eluted by resuspending the beads in 100 microL 100 mM NaOH, incubating for 5 minutes, removing the beads, then adding 100 microL 100 mM HCl and 50 microL Neutralization buffer (200 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween-20). At this point, the typical yield was 1-5 nM single-stranded library. Aliquots were rom these were run on  with 187ds_).
!Sample_data_processing = Read quality filtering and barcode extraction: Every read that was considered valid by the Illumina HiSeq control software was processed and filtered as follows: a) any 3' bases with a quality score of 'B' were removed; b) the well-identifying barcode was extracted from the 5' end of the read; c) if the read ended in a poly(A)-sequence leaving less than 25 transcript-derived bases, the read was discarded; d) the 8-base UMI was extracted from the 5' end and if any of the UMI bases had a Phred score less than 17 the read was discarded; e) a maximum of nine template-switching generated Gs were removed from the 5' end of the transcript-derived sequence; f) if the remaining sequence consisted of less than six non-A bases, or a dinucleotide repeat with less than six other bases at either end, the read was discarded.
!Sample_data_processing = Alignment:the reads were aligned to the genome using the Bowtie aligner, allowing for up to three mismatches and up to 24 alternative mappings for each read. The genome included an artifical chromosome, containing a concatamer of the ERCC control sequences. Any reads with no alignments were re-aligned against another artifical chromosome, containing all possible splice junctions arising from the exons defined by the known transcript variants. Reads mapping within these splice junctions were translated back to the corresponding actual genomic positions. The UCSC transcript models22 were used for the expression level calculation. If a locus had several transcript variants, the exons of these were merged to a combined model that represented all expression from the locus. To account for incompete cap site knowledge, the 5' ends of all models were extended by 100 bases, but not beyond the 3' end of any upstream nearby exon of another gene of the same orientation.
!Sample_data_processing = Annotation and quantitation: The annotation step was performed barcode-by-barcode. For every unique mapping (genomic position and strand) the number of reads in each UMI was counted. Any multiread that had one or more repeat mappings that was outside exons, was assigned randomly as one of these repeats and contributed to the summarized read count of that repeat class. Else, if it had one or more mappings to exons, it was assigned at the exon where it was closest to the transcript model 5' end, even if the sequence was repeat-like. If it had no exon mapping, it was assigned randomly at one of the mappings. After assigning reads, the number of molecules at each mapping position was determined by the number of distinct UMIs observed. To account for UMIs that stem from PCR-induced mutations or sequencing errors, any UMI that had fewer reads than 1/100 of the average of the non-zero UMIs was excluded. The raw UMI count was corrected for the UMI collision probability (important only at high UMI counts) as described10. The expression level of each transcript model was taken as the total number of molecules at all its possible mapping positions.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = 20 microL lysis buffer (0.15% Triton X-100, 1 U/microL TaKaRa RNase inhibitor, 4 microM reverse transcription primer C1-P1-T31, 5% C1 Loading Reagent and 1:50,000 Life Technologies ERCC  Spike-In Mix 1), reverse transcription mix (1x SuperScript II First-Strand Buffer supplemented with 3 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM dNTP, 4 mM DTT, 3.3% C1 Loading Reagent, 1.8 microM template-switching oligo C1-P1-RNA-TSO, 1.5 U/microL TaKaRa RNase inhibitor and 18 U/microL Life Technologies Superscript II reverse transcriptase) and PCR mix (1.1x Clontech Advantage2 PCR buffer, 440 microM dNTP, 530 nM PCR primer C1-P1-PCR-2, 5% C1 Loading Reagent and 2x Advantage2 Polymerase Mix) were added to the designated wells according to the manufacturer's instructions, but using the indicated mixes in place of the corresponding commmercial reagents. The plate was then returned to the Fluidigm C1 and the mRNA Seq: RT + Amp (1772x/1773x) script was executed, which took about 8.5 hours and included lysis, reverse transcription and 21 cycles of PCR. When the run finished, the amplified cDNA was harvested in a total of 13 microL C1 Harvesting Reagent and quantified on an Agilent BioAnalyzer. The typical yield was 1 ng/microL. Amplified cDNA was simultaneously fragmented and barcoded by tagmentation, i.e. using Tn5 DNA transposase to transfer adapters to the target DNA. 96 different 10x transposome stocks (6.25 microM barcoded adapter C1-TN5-x, 40% glycerol, 6.25 microM Tn5 transposase, where x denotes a well-specific barcode) were prepared, each with a different barcode sequence.  6 microL harvested cDNA was mixed with 5 microL tagmentation buffer (50 mM TAPS-NaOH pH 8.5, 25 mM MgCl2 and 50% DMF), 11.5 microL nuclease-free water and 2.5 microL 10x transposome stock. The mix was incubated for 5 minutes at 55 degeees C then cooled on ice. 100 microL Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 beads were washed in 2xBWT (10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 2 M NaCl, 0.02% Tween-20) then resuspended in 2 mL 2xBWT. 20 microL beads was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. All fractions were pooled, the beads were immobilized and the supernatant removed (thus removing all internal fragments, and retaining only the 5'- and 3'-most fragments). The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL TNT (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.02% Tween), washed in 100 microL Qiagen Qiaquick PB, then twice in 100 microL TNT. The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL restriction mix (1x NEB NEBuffer 4, 0.4 U/microL PvuI-HF enzyme), designed to cleave 3' fragments carrying the PvuI recognition site. The mix was incubated for one hour at 37 degrees C, then washed three times in TNT. Finally, the single-stranded library was eluted by resuspending the beads in 100 microL 100 mM NaOH, incubating for 5 minutes, removing the beads, then adding 100 microL 100 mM HCl and 50 microL Neutralization buffer (200 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween-20). At this point, the typical yield was 1-5 nM single-stranded library. Aliquots were rom these were run on  with 187ds_).
!Sample_data_processing = Read quality filtering and barcode extraction: Every read that was considered valid by the Illumina HiSeq control software was processed and filtered as follows: a) any 3' bases with a quality score of 'B' were removed; b) the well-identifying barcode was extracted from the 5' end of the read; c) if the read ended in a poly(A)-sequence leaving less than 25 transcript-derived bases, the read was discarded; d) the 8-base UMI was extracted from the 5' end and if any of the UMI bases had a Phred score less than 17 the read was discarded; e) a maximum of nine template-switching generated Gs were removed from the 5' end of the transcript-derived sequence; f) if the remaining sequence consisted of less than six non-A bases, or a dinucleotide repeat with less than six other bases at either end, the read was discarded.
!Sample_data_processing = Alignment:the reads were aligned to the genome using the Bowtie aligner, allowing for up to three mismatches and up to 24 alternative mappings for each read. The genome included an artifical chromosome, containing a concatamer of the ERCC control sequences. Any reads with no alignments were re-aligned against another artifical chromosome, containing all possible splice junctions arising from the exons defined by the known transcript variants. Reads mapping within these splice junctions were translated back to the corresponding actual genomic positions. The UCSC transcript models22 were used for the expression level calculation. If a locus had several transcript variants, the exons of these were merged to a combined model that represented all expression from the locus. To account for incompete cap site knowledge, the 5' ends of all models were extended by 100 bases, but not beyond the 3' end of any upstream nearby exon of another gene of the same orientation.
!Sample_data_processing = Annotation and quantitation: The annotation step was performed barcode-by-barcode. For every unique mapping (genomic position and strand) the number of reads in each UMI was counted. Any multiread that had one or more repeat mappings that was outside exons, was assigned randomly as one of these repeats and contributed to the summarized read count of that repeat class. Else, if it had one or more mappings to exons, it was assigned at the exon where it was closest to the transcript model 5' end, even if the sequence was repeat-like. If it had no exon mapping, it was assigned randomly at one of the mappings. After assigning reads, the number of molecules at each mapping position was determined by the number of distinct UMIs observed. To account for UMIs that stem from PCR-induced mutations or sequencing errors, any UMI that had fewer reads than 1/100 of the average of the non-zero UMIs was excluded. The raw UMI count was corrected for the UMI collision probability (important only at high UMI counts) as described10. The expression level of each transcript model was taken as the total number of molecules at all its possible mapping positions.

When the run finished, the amplified cDNA was harvested in a total of 13 microL C1 Harvesting Reagent and quantified on an Agilent BioAnalyzer. The typical yield was 1 ng/microL. Amplified cDNA was simultaneously fragmented and barcoded by tagmentation, i.e. using Tn5 DNA transposase to transfer adapters to the target DNA. 96 different 10x transposome stocks (6.25 microM barcoded adapter C1-TN5-x, 40% glycerol, 6.25 microM Tn5 transposase, where x denotes a well-specific barcode) were prepared, each with a different barcode sequence.  6 microL harvested cDNA was mixed with 5 microL tagmentation buffer (50 mM TAPS-NaOH pH 8.5, 25 mM MgCl2 and 50% DMF), 11.5 microL nuclease-free water and 2.5 microL 10x transposome stock. The mix was incubated for 5 minutes at 55 degeees C then cooled on ice. 100 microL Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 beads were washed in 2xBWT (10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 2 M NaCl, 0.02% Tween-20) then resuspended in 2 mL 2xBWT. 20 microL beads was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. All fractions were pooled, the beads were immobilized and the supernatant removed (thus removing all internal fragments, and retaining only the 5'- and 3'-most fragments). The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL TNT (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.02% Tween), washed in 100 microL Qiagen Qiaquick PB, then twice in 100 microL TNT. The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL restriction mix (1x NEB NEBuffer 4, 0.4 U/microL PvuI-HF enzyme), designed to cleave 3' fragments carrying the PvuI recognition site. The mix was incubated for one hour at 37 degrees C, then washed three times in TNT. Finally, the single-stranded library was eluted by resuspending the beads in 100 microL 100 mM NaOH, incubating for 5 minutes, removing the beads, then adding 100 microL 100 mM HCl and 50 microL Neutralization buffer (200 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween-20). At this point, the typical yield was 1-5 nM single-stranded library. Aliquots were rom these were run on  with 187ds_).
!Sample_data_processing = Read quality filtering and barcode extraction: Every read that was considered valid by the Illumina HiSeq control software was processed and filtered as follows: a) any 3' bases with a quality score of 'B' were removed; b) the well-identifying barcode was extracted from the 5' end of the read; c) if the read ended in a poly(A)-sequence leaving less than 25 transcript-derived bases, the read was discarded; d) the 8-base UMI was extracted from the 5' end and if any of the UMI bases had a Phred score less than 17 the read was discarded; e) a maximum of nine template-switching generated Gs were removed from the 5' end of the transcript-derived sequence; f) if the remaining sequence consisted of less than six non-A bases, or a dinucleotide repeat with less than six other bases at either end, the read was discarded.
!Sample_data_processing = Alignment:the reads were aligned to the genome using the Bowtie aligner, allowing for up to three mismatches and up to 24 alternative mappings for each read. The genome included an artifical chromosome, containing a concatamer of the ERCC control sequences. Any reads with no alignments were re-aligned against another artifical chromosome, containing all possible splice junctions arising from the exons defined by the known transcript variants. Reads mapping within these splice junctions were translated back to the corresponding actual genomic positions. The UCSC transcript models22 were used for the expression level calculation. If a locus had several transcript variants, the exons of these were merged to a combined model that represented all expression from the locus. To account for incompete cap site knowledge, the 5' ends of all models were extended by 100 bases, but not beyond the 3' end of any upstream nearby exon of another gene of the same orientation.
!Sample_data_processing = Annotation and quantitation: The annotation step was performed barcode-by-barcode. For every unique mapping (genomic position and strand) the number of reads in each UMI was counted. Any multiread that had one or more repeat mappings that was outside exons, was assigned randomly as one of these repeats and contributed to the summarized read count of that repeat class. Else, if it had one or more mappings to exons, it was assigned at the exon where it was closest to the transcript model 5' end, even if the sequence was repeat-like. If it had no exon mapping, it was assigned randomly at one of the mappings. After assigning reads, the number of molecules at each mapping position was determined by the number of distinct UMIs observed. To account for UMIs that stem from PCR-induced mutations or sequencing errors, any UMI that had fewer reads than 1/100 of the average of the non-zero UMIs was excluded. The raw UMI count was corrected for the UMI collision probability (important only at high UMI counts) as described10. The expression level of each transcript model was taken as the total number of molecules at all its possible mapping positions.

Amplified cDNA was simultaneously fragmented and barcoded by tagmentation, i.e. using Tn5 DNA transposase to transfer adapters to the target DNA. 96 different 10x transposome stocks (6.25 microM barcoded adapter C1-TN5-x, 40% glycerol, 6.25 microM Tn5 transposase, where x denotes a well-specific barcode) were prepared, each with a different barcode sequence.  6 microL harvested cDNA was mixed with 5 microL tagmentation buffer (50 mM TAPS-NaOH pH 8.5, 25 mM MgCl2 and 50% DMF), 11.5 microL nuclease-free water and 2.5 microL 10x transposome stock. The mix was incubated for 5 minutes at 55 degeees C then cooled on ice. 100 microL Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 beads were washed in 2xBWT (10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 2 M NaCl, 0.02% Tween-20) then resuspended in 2 mL 2xBWT. 20 microL beads was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. All fractions were pooled, the beads were immobilized and the supernatant removed (thus removing all internal fragments, and retaining only the 5'- and 3'-most fragments). The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL TNT (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.02% Tween), washed in 100 microL Qiagen Qiaquick PB, then twice in 100 microL TNT. The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL restriction mix (1x NEB NEBuffer 4, 0.4 U/microL PvuI-HF enzyme), designed to cleave 3' fragments carrying the PvuI recognition site. The mix was incubated for one hour at 37 degrees C, then washed three times in TNT. Finally, the single-stranded library was eluted by resuspending the beads in 100 microL 100 mM NaOH, incubating for 5 minutes, removing the beads, then adding 100 microL 100 mM HCl and 50 microL Neutralization buffer (200 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween-20). At this point, the typical yield was 1-5 nM single-stranded library. Aliquots were rom these were run on  with 187ds_).
!Sample_data_processing = Read quality filtering and barcode extraction: Every read that was considered valid by the Illumina HiSeq control software was processed and filtered as follows: a) any 3' bases with a quality score of 'B' were removed; b) the well-identifying barcode was extracted from the 5' end of the read; c) if the read ended in a poly(A)-sequence leaving less than 25 transcript-derived bases, the read was discarded; d) the 8-base UMI was extracted from the 5' end and if any of the UMI bases had a Phred score less than 17 the read was discarded; e) a maximum of nine template-switching generated Gs were removed from the 5' end of the transcript-derived sequence; f) if the remaining sequence consisted of less than six non-A bases, or a dinucleotide repeat with less than six other bases at either end, the read was discarded.
!Sample_data_processing = Alignment:the reads were aligned to the genome using the Bowtie aligner, allowing for up to three mismatches and up to 24 alternative mappings for each read. The genome included an artifical chromosome, containing a concatamer of the ERCC control sequences. Any reads with no alignments were re-aligned against another artifical chromosome, containing all possible splice junctions arising from the exons defined by the known transcript variants. Reads mapping within these splice junctions were translated back to the corresponding actual genomic positions. The UCSC transcript models22 were used for the expression level calculation. If a locus had several transcript variants, the exons of these were merged to a combined model that represented all expression from the locus. To account for incompete cap site knowledge, the 5' ends of all models were extended by 100 bases, but not beyond the 3' end of any upstream nearby exon of another gene of the same orientation.
!Sample_data_processing = Annotation and quantitation: The annotation step was performed barcode-by-barcode. For every unique mapping (genomic position and strand) the number of reads in each UMI was counted. Any multiread that had one or more repeat mappings that was outside exons, was assigned randomly as one of these repeats and contributed to the summarized read count of that repeat class. Else, if it had one or more mappings to exons, it was assigned at the exon where it was closest to the transcript model 5' end, even if the sequence was repeat-like. If it had no exon mapping, it was assigned randomly at one of the mappings. After assigning reads, the number of molecules at each mapping position was determined by the number of distinct UMIs observed. To account for UMIs that stem from PCR-induced mutations or sequencing errors, any UMI that had fewer reads than 1/100 of the average of the non-zero UMIs was excluded. The raw UMI count was corrected for the UMI collision probability (important only at high UMI counts) as described10. The expression level of each transcript model was taken as the total number of molecules at all its possible mapping positions.

All fractions were pooled, the beads were immobilized and the supernatant removed (thus removing all internal fragments, and retaining only the 5'- and 3'-most fragments). The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL TNT (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.02% Tween), washed in 100 microL Qiagen Qiaquick PB, then twice in 100 microL TNT. The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL restriction mix (1x NEB NEBuffer 4, 0.4 U/microL PvuI-HF enzyme), designed to cleave 3' fragments carrying the PvuI recognition site. The mix was incubated for one hour at 37 degrees C, then washed three times in TNT. Finally, the single-stranded library was eluted by resuspending the beads in 100 microL 100 mM NaOH, incubating for 5 minutes, removing the beads, then adding 100 microL 100 mM HCl and 50 microL Neutralization buffer (200 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween-20). At this point, the typical yield was 1-5 nM single-stranded library. Aliquots were rom these were run on  with 187ds_).
!Sample_data_processing = Read quality filtering and barcode extraction: Every read that was considered valid by the Illumina HiSeq control software was processed and filtered as follows: a) any 3' bases with a quality score of 'B' were removed; b) the well-identifying barcode was extracted from the 5' end of the read; c) if the read ended in a poly(A)-sequence leaving less than 25 transcript-derived bases, the read was discarded; d) the 8-base UMI was extracted from the 5' end and if any of the UMI bases had a Phred score less than 17 the read was discarded; e) a maximum of nine template-switching generated Gs were removed from the 5' end of the transcript-derived sequence; f) if the remaining sequence consisted of less than six non-A bases, or a dinucleotide repeat with less than six other bases at either end, the read was discarded.
!Sample_data_processing = Alignment:the reads were aligned to the genome using the Bowtie aligner, allowing for up to three mismatches and up to 24 alternative mappings for each read. The genome included an artifical chromosome, containing a concatamer of the ERCC control sequences. Any reads with no alignments were re-aligned against another artifical chromosome, containing all possible splice junctions arising from the exons defined by the known transcript variants. Reads mapping within these splice junctions were translated back to the corresponding actual genomic positions. The UCSC transcript models22 were used for the expression level calculation. If a locus had several transcript variants, the exons of these were merged to a combined model that represented all expression from the locus. To account for incompete cap site knowledge, the 5' ends of all models were extended by 100 bases, but not beyond the 3' end of any upstream nearby exon of another gene of the same orientation.
!Sample_data_processing = Annotation and quantitation: The annotation step was performed barcode-by-barcode. For every unique mapping (genomic position and strand) the number of reads in each UMI was counted. Any multiread that had one or more repeat mappings that was outside exons, was assigned randomly as one of these repeats and contributed to the summarized read count of that repeat class. Else, if it had one or more mappings to exons, it was assigned at the exon where it was closest to the transcript model 5' end, even if the sequence was repeat-like. If it had no exon mapping, it was assigned randomly at one of the mappings. After assigning reads, the number of molecules at each mapping position was determined by the number of distinct UMIs observed. To account for UMIs that stem from PCR-induced mutations or sequencing errors, any UMI that had fewer reads than 1/100 of the average of the non-zero UMIs was excluded. The raw UMI count was corrected for the UMI collision probability (important only at high UMI counts) as described10. The expression level of each transcript model was taken as the total number of molecules at all its possible mapping positions.

The beads were then resuspended in 100 microL restriction mix (1x NEB NEBuffer 4, 0.4 U/microL PvuI-HF enzyme), designed to cleave 3' fragments carrying the PvuI recognition site. The mix was incubated for one hour at 37 degrees C, then washed three times in TNT. Finally, the single-stranded library was eluted by resuspending the beads in 100 microL 100 mM NaOH, incubating for 5 minutes, removing the beads, then adding 100 microL 100 mM HCl and 50 microL Neutralization buffer (200 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween-20). At this point, the typical yield was 1-5 nM single-stranded library. Aliquots were rom these were run on  with 187ds_).
!Sample_data_processing = Read quality filtering and barcode extraction: Every read that was considered valid by the Illumina HiSeq control software was processed and filtered as follows: a) any 3' bases with a quality score of 'B' were removed; b) the well-identifying barcode was extracted from the 5' end of the read; c) if the read ended in a poly(A)-sequence leaving less than 25 transcript-derived bases, the read was discarded; d) the 8-base UMI was extracted from the 5' end and if any of the UMI bases had a Phred score less than 17 the read was discarded; e) a maximum of nine template-switching generated Gs were removed from the 5' end of the transcript-derived sequence; f) if the remaining sequence consisted of less than six non-A bases, or a dinucleotide repeat with less than six other bases at either end, the read was discarded.
!Sample_data_processing = Alignment:the reads were aligned to the genome using the Bowtie aligner, allowing for up to three mismatches and up to 24 alternative mappings for each read. The genome included an artifical chromosome, containing a concatamer of the ERCC control sequences. Any reads with no alignments were re-aligned against another artifical chromosome, containing all possible splice junctions arising from the exons defined by the known transcript variants. Reads mapping within these splice junctions were translated back to the corresponding actual genomic positions. The UCSC transcript models22 were used for the expression level calculation. If a locus had several transcript variants, the exons of these were merged to a combined model that represented all expression from the locus. To account for incompete cap site knowledge, the 5' ends of all models were extended by 100 bases, but not beyond the 3' end of any upstream nearby exon of another gene of the same orientation.
!Sample_data_processing = Annotation and quantitation: The annotation step was performed barcode-by-barcode. For every unique mapping (genomic position and strand) the number of reads in each UMI was counted. Any multiread that had one or more repeat mappings that was outside exons, was assigned randomly as one of these repeats and contributed to the summarized read count of that repeat class. Else, if it had one or more mappings to exons, it was assigned at the exon where it was closest to the transcript model 5' end, even if the sequence was repeat-like. If it had no exon mapping, it was assigned randomly at one of the mappings. After assigning reads, the number of molecules at each mapping position was determined by the number of distinct UMIs observed. To account for UMIs that stem from PCR-induced mutations or sequencing errors, any UMI that had fewer reads than 1/100 of the average of the non-zero UMIs was excluded. The raw UMI count was corrected for the UMI collision probability (important only at high UMI counts) as described10. The expression level of each transcript model was taken as the total number of molecules at all its possible mapping positions.

!Sample_data_processing = Read quality filtering and barcode extraction: Every read that was considered valid by the Illumina HiSeq control software was processed and filtered as follows: a) any 3' bases with a quality score of 'B' were removed; b) the well-identifying barcode was extracted from the 5' end of the read; c) if the read ended in a poly(A)-sequence leaving less than 25 transcript-derived bases, the read was discarded; d) the 8-base UMI was extracted from the 5' end and if any of the UMI bases had a Phred score less than 17 the read was discarded; e) a maximum of nine template-switching generated Gs were removed from the 5' end of the transcript-derived sequence; f) if the remaining sequence consisted of less than six non-A bases, or a dinucleotide repeat with less than six other bases at either end, the read was discarded.
!Sample_data_processing = Alignment:the reads were aligned to the genome using the Bowtie aligner, allowing for up to three mismatches and up to 24 alternative mappings for each read. The genome included an artifical chromosome, containing a concatamer of the ERCC control sequences. Any reads with no alignments were re-aligned against another artifical chromosome, containing all possible splice junctions arising from the exons defined by the known transcript variants. Reads mapping within these splice junctions were translated back to the corresponding actual genomic positions. The UCSC transcript models22 were used for the expression level calculation. If a locus had several transcript variants, the exons of these were merged to a combined model that represented all expression from the locus. To account for incompete cap site knowledge, the 5' ends of all models were extended by 100 bases, but not beyond the 3' end of any upstream nearby exon of another gene of the same orientation.
!Sample_data_processing = Annotation and quantitation: The annotation step was performed barcode-by-barcode. For every unique mapping (genomic position and strand) the number of reads in each UMI was counted. Any multiread that had one or more repeat mappings that was outside exons, was assigned randomly as one of these repeats and contributed to the summarized read count of that repeat class. Else, if it had one or more mappings to exons, it was assigned at the exon where it was closest to the transcript model 5' end, even if the sequence was repeat-like. If it had no exon mapping, it was assigned randomly at one of the mappings. After assigning reads, the number of molecules at each mapping position was determined by the number of distinct UMIs observed. To account for UMIs that stem from PCR-induced mutations or sequencing errors, any UMI that had fewer reads than 1/100 of the average of the non-zero UMIs was excluded. The raw UMI count was corrected for the UMI collision probability (important only at high UMI counts) as described10. The expression level of each transcript model was taken as the total number of molecules at all its possible mapping positions.

The plate was then returned to the Fluidigm C1 and the mRNA Seq: RT + Amp (1772x/1773x) script was executed, which took about 8.5 hours and included lysis, reverse transcription and 21 cycles of PCR. When the run finished, the amplified cDNA was harvested in a total of 13 microL C1 Harvesting Reagent and quantified on an Agilent BioAnalyzer. The typical yield was 1 ng/microL.

Any reads with no alignments were re-aligned against another artifical chromosome, containing all possible splice junctions arising from the exons defined by the known transcript variants. Reads mapping within these splice junctions were translated back to the corresponding actual genomic positions. The UCSC transcript models22 were used for the expression level calculation. If a locus had several transcript variants, the exons of these were merged to a combined model that represented all expression from the locus. To account for incompete cap site knowledge, the 5' ends of all models were extended by 100 bases, but not beyond the 3' end of any upstream nearby exon of another gene of the same orientation.
!Sample_data_processing = Annotation and quantitation: The annotation step was performed barcode-by-barcode. For every unique mapping (genomic position and strand) the number of reads in each UMI was counted. Any multiread that had one or more repeat mappings that was outside exons, was assigned randomly as one of these repeats and contributed to the summarized read count of that repeat class. Else, if it had one or more mappings to exons, it was assigned at the exon where it was closest to the transcript model 5' end, even if the sequence was repeat-like. If it had no exon mapping, it was assigned randomly at one of the mappings. After assigning reads, the number of molecules at each mapping position was determined by the number of distinct UMIs observed. To account for UMIs that stem from PCR-induced mutations or sequencing errors, any UMI that had fewer reads than 1/100 of the average of the non-zero UMIs was excluded. The raw UMI count was corrected for the UMI collision probability (important only at high UMI counts) as described10. The expression level of each transcript model was taken as the total number of molecules at all its possible mapping positions.
